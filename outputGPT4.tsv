1	RadcASR.txt|0|u	  A SICILIAN ROMANCE. ON the northern shore of Sicily are still to be seen the magnificent remains of a castle, which formerly belonged to the noble house of Mazzini. It stands in the centre of a small bay, and upon a gentle acclivity, which, on one side, slopes towards the sea, and on the other rises into an eminence crowned by dark woods. The situation is admirably beautiful and picturesque, and the ruins have an air of ancient grandeur, which, contrasted with the present solitude of the scene, impresses the traveller with awe and curiosity. During my travels abroad I visited this spot. As I walked over the loose fragments  of stone, which lay scattered through the immense area of the fabrick, and surveyed the sublimity and grandeur of the ruins, I recurred, by a natural association of ideas, to the times when these walls stood proudly in their original splendour, when the halls were the scenes of hospitality and festive magnificence, and when they resounded with the voices of those whom death had long since swept from the earth. 'Thus, said I,' shall the present generation he who now sinks in misery and he who now swims in pleasure, alike pass away and be forgotten.' My heart swelled with the reflection; and, as I turned from the scene with a sigh, I fixed my eyes upon a friar, whose venerable figure, gently bending towards the earth, formed no uninteresting object in the picture. He observed my emotion; and, as my eye met his, shook his head and pointed to the ruin. 'These walls,' 	52560000.0	45	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator describes visiting the ruins of a castle in Sicily, reflecting on the passage of time and the people who once inhabited the castle, and noticing a friar nearby who comments on the ruins. 2: The passage describes the narrator's visit to the castle ruins, which likely takes around 30 minutes to an hour, considering the time spent walking around, surveying the area, and reflecting on the past. 3: The midpoint of the range (30 minutes to 1 hour) is 45 minutes. 4: 45 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

Madame de Menon, disturbed at this phaenomenon, hastened into the castle, with a view of enquiring into the cause of it, when she was met in the north hall by Vincent. She related to him what she had seen, and ordered an immediate search to be made for the keys of those apartments. She apprehended  that some person had penetrated that part of the edifice with an intention of plunder; and, disdaining a paltry fear where her duty was concerned, she summoned the servants of the castle, with an intention of accompanying them thither. Vincent smiled at her apprehensions, and imputed what she had seen to an illusion, which the solemnity of the hour had impressed upon her fancy. Madame, however, persevered in her purpose; and, after a long and repeated search, a massey key covered with rust was produced. She then proceeded to the southern side of the edifice, accompanied by Vincent, and followed by the servants, who were agitated with impatient wonder. The key was applied to an iron gate, which opened into a court that separated this division from the other parts of the castle. They entered this court, which was overgrown with grass and weeds, and ascended some steps that led to a large door,  which they vainly endeavoured to open. 	120.0	20	[3, 1, 2, 0]	VALID	1: Madame de Menon and Vincent observe a strange phenomenon, and she decides to investigate a locked part of the castle. They search for the keys, find them, and attempt to open a door.  2: The events described include observing the phenomenon, discussing it, searching for the keys, and attempting to open the door. This could take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes.  3: The midpoint of the range is 20 minutes.  4: 20 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.

Julia, almost fainting, gave her hand to Ferdinand; and Hippolitus, after some short expression of his thankfulness, followed. They passed the door of Madame's chamber;  and treading the gallery with slow and silent steps, descended to the hall. This they crossed towards a door, after opening which they were to find their way through various passages to a remote part of the castle, where a private door opened upon the walls. Ferdinand carried the several keys. They fastened the hall door after them, and proceeded through a narrow passage terminating in a stair-case. They descended, and had hardly reached the bottom, when they heard a loud noise at the door above, and presently the voices of several people. Julia scarcely felt the ground she trod on, and Ferdinand slew to unlock a door that obstructed their way. He applied the different keys, and at length found the proper one, but the lock was rusted, and refused to yield. Their distress now was not to be conceived. 	10.0	10	[3, 0, 1, 2]	VALID	1: The passage describes a group of people trying to escape a castle. They move through various passages and descend a staircase, but encounter a locked door that is difficult to open. 2: The characters move through the castle, descend a staircase, and struggle with a locked door. This could take anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes. 3: The midpoint of the range is 10 minutes. 4: 10 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

Henceforth be cautions how ye credit the phantasms of idleness, for ye may not always meet with a master who will condescend to undeceive ye.' They acknowledged the goodness of the marquis, and professing themselves perfectly conscious of the error of their former suspicions, desired they might search no farther. 'I chuse to leave nothing to your imagination,' replied  the marquis, lest hereafter it should betray you into a similar error. Follow me, therefore; you shall see the whole of these buildings.' Saying this he led them to the south tower. They remembered, that from a door of this tower, the figure which caused their alarm had issued; and notwithstanding the late assertion of their suspicions being removed, fear still operated powerfully upon their minds, and they would willingly have been excused from farther research. 'Would any of you chuse to explore this tower?' said the marquis, pointing to the broken stair-case; 'for myself I am mortal, and therefore fear to venture, but you who hold communion with disembodied spirits, may partake something of their nature, if so, you may pass without apprehension where the ghost has probably passed before.' They shrunk at this reproof, and were silent. The marquis, turning to a door on  his right hand, ordered it to be unlocked. 	7.0	4	[3, 0, 1, 2]	VALID	1: The passage describes a marquis leading a group of people through a castle, discussing their fears of ghosts and spirits. He challenges them to explore a tower and then orders a door to be unlocked. 2: The events described in the passage seem to occur in real-time, with the marquis speaking and leading the group through the castle. This would likely take a few minutes, perhaps between 3 to 5 minutes. 3: The midpoint of the range is 4 minutes. 4: 4 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
6	RadcASR.txt|109|u	She was ordered to confine herself to her apartment till her innocence should be cleared, or her sister discovered. From Madame de Menon she received a faithful sympathy, which was the sole relief of her oppressed heart. Her anxiety concerning Julia daily encreased, and was heightened into the most terrifying apprehensions for her safety. She knew of no person in whom her sister could confide, or of  any place where she could find protection; the most deplorable evils were therefore to be expected. One day as she was sitting at the window of her apartment, engaged in melancholy reflection, she saw a man riding towards the castle on full speed. Her heart beat with fear and expectation, for his haste made her suspect he brought intelligence of Julia, and she could scarcely refrain from breaking through the command of the marquis, and rushing into the hall to learn something of his errand. She was right in her conjecture; the person she had seen was a spy of the marquis's, and came to inform him that the lady Julia was at that time concealed in a cottage of the forest of Marentino. The marquis rejoiced at this intelligence, and gave the man a liberal reward. He learned also, that she was accompanied by a young cavalier, which circumstance surprized him exceedingly, for he knew of no person  except the count de Vereza with whom she could have entrusted herself, and the count had fallen by his sword! He immediately ordered a party of his people to accompany the messenger to the forest of Marentino, and to suffer neither Julia nor the cavalier to escape them on pain of death. 	20160.0	90	[3, 1, 2, 0]	VALID	1: A woman is confined to her apartment, worried about her sister Julia. She sees a man riding towards the castle and learns he brings news of Julia's whereabouts. The marquis orders his people to find Julia and the accompanying cavalier.  2: The passage describes the woman's thoughts and feelings, the arrival of the man on horseback, and the marquis's reaction. The events described likely take place within an hour or two, as the woman observes the man's arrival and the marquis responds to the news.  3: 1.5 hours have elapsed. Multiplying by 60 minutes an hour, that's 90 minutes.  4: 90 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.

Corn, vineyards, olives, and groves of mulberry trees adorned the hills. The vallies, luxuriant in shade, were frequently embellished by the windings of a lucid stream, and diversified by clusters of half-seen cottages. Here the rising turrets of a monastery appeared above the thick trees with which they were surrounded; and there the savage wilds, the travellers had passed, formed a bold and picturesque back-ground to the scene. To the questions put by the duke to the several persons he met, he received answers that encouraged him to proceed. At noon he halted at a village to refresh himself and his people. He  could gain no intelligence of Julia, and was perplexed which way to chuse; but determined at length to pursue the road he was then in, and accordingly again set forward. He travelled several miles without meeting any person who could give the necessary information, and began to despair of success. 	360.0	75	[3, 1, 2, 0]	VALID	1: The passage describes a group of travelers, led by the duke, searching for fugitives. They eat a quick meal, continue their journey, and stop at a village at noon. They then proceed without finding any useful information. 2: The passage mentions a meal and a stop at a village at noon. The time spent eating and resting at the village is not specified, but we can estimate it to be between 30 minutes to 2 hours. 3: The midpoint of the range is 1 hour and 15 minutes (75 minutes). 4: 75 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence, as the time spent eating and resting at the village is not explicitly stated.
8	RadcASR.txt|137|u	He then assured them, that since indulgence had only encouraged intrusion, he would for the future be severe;  vere; and concluded with declaring, that the first man who should disturb him with a repetition of such ridiculous apprehensions, or should attempt to disturb the peace of the castle by circulating these idle notions, should be rigorously punished, and banished his dominions. They shrunk back at this reproof, and were silent. 'Bring a torch,' said the marquis, 'and shew me to the dungeon. I will once more condescend to confute you.' They obeyed, and descended with the marquis, who, arriving at the dungeon, instantly threw open the door, and discovered to the astonished eyes of his attendants Ferdinand! He started with surprize at the entrance of his father thus attended. The marquis darting upon him a severe look, which he perfectly comprehended 'Now,' cried he, turning to his people, 'what do you see? My son, whom I myself placed here, and whose voice, which  answered to your calls, you have transformed into unknown sounds. 'Speak, Ferdinand, and confirm what I say.' Ferdinand did so. 'What dreadful spectre appeared to you last night? Resumed the marquis, looking stedfastly upon him: gratify these fellows with a description of it, for they cannot exist without something of the marvelous.' 'None my lord,' replied Ferdinand, who too well understood the manner of the marquis. 'Tis well,' cried the marquis, 'and this is the last time,' turning to his attendants, 'that your folly shall be treated with so much lenity.' 	10.0	7.5	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The passage describes a marquis reprimanding his attendants for their superstitions and fears, then taking them to a dungeon to prove that the source of their fears is his son, Ferdinand, who is locked inside. 2: The events described in the passage include the marquis's speech, the attendants' reactions, and the journey to the dungeon. This would likely take around 5 to 10 minutes. 3: The midpoint of the range is 7.5 minutes. 4: 7.5 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
9	RadcASR.txt|148|u	She now opened the door, and to her inexpressible astonishment and distress, found the cottage empty. She proceeded to a small inner room, where lay a part of Julia's apparel. The bed had no appearance of having been slept in, and every moment served to heighten and confirm her apprehensions. While she pursued the search, she suddenly heard the trampling of feet at the cottage door, and presently after some people entered. Her fears for Julia now yielded to those for her own safety, and she was undetermined  whether to discover herself, or remain in her present situation, when she was relieved from her irresolution and distress by the appearance of Julia. On the return of the good woman, who had accompanied Madame to the village on the preceding night, Julia went to the cottage at Farrini. Her grateful heart would not suffer her to depart without taking leave of her faithful friends, thanking them for their kindness, and informing them of her future prospects. They had prevailed upon her to spend the few intervening hours at this cot, whence she had just risen to meet Madame. They now hastened to the spot where the horses were stationed,and commenced their journey. For some leagues they travelled in silence and thought, over a wild and picturesque country. The landscape was tinted with rich and variegated hues; and the autumnal lights, which streamed upon the hills, produced  a spirited and beautiful effect upon the scenery. All the glories of the vintage rose to their view: the purple grapes flushed through the dark green of the surrounding foliage, and the prospect glowed with warm luxuriance. 	222.0	65	[2, 0, 1, 3]	VALID	1: The passage describes a woman searching for Julia in a cottage, finding her, and then they both set off on a journey through a picturesque landscape. 2: The time elapsed in the passage includes searching the cottage, the reunion, and the beginning of their journey. The search and reunion might take around 10-15 minutes, and the description of the journey could be an additional 30 minutes to an hour. 3: Taking the midpoint of the range (10-15 minutes for the search and reunion, and 30-60 minutes for the journey), we have 20 minutes for the search and reunion, and 45 minutes for the journey. In total, that's 65 minutes. 4: 65 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
10	RadcASR.txt|160|u	'Of the life which your care has  prolonged,' said she, 'it is but just that you should know the events; though those events are neither new, or striking, and possess little power of interesting persons unconnected with them. To me they have, however, been unexpectedly dreadful in effect, and my heart assures me, that to you they will not be indifferent.' 'I am the unfortunate descendant of an ancient and illustrious Italian family. In early childhood I was deprived of a mother's care, but the tenderness of my surviving parent made her loss, as to my welfare, almost unfelt. Suffer me here to do justice to the character of my noble father. He united in an eminent degree, the mild virtues of social life, with the firm unbending qualities of the noble Romans, his ancesters, from whom he was proud to trace his descent. Their merit, indeed, continually dwelt on his tongue, and their actions he was always endeavouring to imitate, as far as was  consistent with the character of his times, and with the limited sphere in which he moved. The recollection of his virtue elevates my mind, and fills my heart with a noble pride, which even the cold walls of a monastery have not been able to subdue. My father's fortune was unsuitable to his rank. That his son might hereafter be enabled to support the dignity of his family, it was necessary for me to assume the veil. Alas! that heart was unfit to be offered at an heavenly shrine, which was already devoted to an earthly object. 	9986400.0	9198000	[1, 2, 0, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator speaks of their life and family history, mentioning their noble father and the decision to enter a monastery due to financial constraints. 2: The passage describes the narrator's life from early childhood to the point of entering the monastery. It is difficult to determine the exact age of the narrator, but we can estimate that the time elapsed is from childhood to young adulthood, which could be around 15 to 20 years. 3: Taking the midpoint of the range (17.5 years), we can convert this to minutes: 17.5 years x 365 days/year x 24 hours/day x 60 minutes/hour = 9,198,000 minutes. 4: 9,198,000 minutes. 5: Low confidence, due to the uncertainty of the narrator's age and the speculative nature of the estimate.
11	RadcASR.txt|174|u	The Abate was alone. His countenance was pale with anger, and he was pacing the room with slow but agitated steps. The stern authority of his look startled her. 'Read this letter,' said he, stretching forth his hand which held a letter, 'and tell me what that mortal deserves, who dares insult our holy order, and set our sacred prerogative at defiance.' Madame distinguished the hand writing of the marquis, and the words of the Superior threw her into the utmost astonishment. She took the  letter. It was dictated by that spirit of proud vindictive rage, which so strongly marked the character of the marquis. Having discovered the retreat of Julia, and believing the monastery afforded her a willing sanctuary from his pursuit, he accused the Abate of encouraging his child in open rebellion to his will. He loaded him and his sacred order with opprobrium, and threatened, if she was not immediately resigned to the emissaries in waiting, he would in person lead on a force which should compel the church to yield to the superior authority of the father. The spirit of the Abate was roused by this menace; and Julia obtained from his pride, that protection which neither his principle nor his humanity would have granted. 'The man shall tremble,' cried he,'who dares defy our power, or question our sacred authority. The lady Julia is safe. I will protect her from this proud invader of our  rights, and teach him at least to venerate the power he cannot conquer. I have dispatched his emissaries with my answer.' 	5.0	3.5	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The Abate is angry about a letter from the Marquis, who accuses the Abate of harboring his daughter Julia. The Abate decides to protect Julia and has already sent a response to the Marquis.  2: The passage describes a single scene in which the Abate shares the letter with Madame and expresses his anger and decision. This scene likely takes between 2 and 5 minutes.  3: The midpoint of the range is 3.5 minutes.  4: 3.5 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
12	RadcASR.txt|178|u	What punishment is adequate to guilt like this?'  The father paused his eyes sternly fixed on Julia, who pale and trembling, could scarcely support herself, and who had no power to reply. 'I will be merciful, and not just,' resumed he, 'I will soften the punishment you deserve, and will only deliver you to your father.' At these dreadful words, Julia bursting into tears, sunk at the feet of the Abate, to whom she raised her eyes in supplicating expression, but was unable to speak. He suffered her to remain in this posture. 'Your duplicity,' he resumed, 'is not the least of your offences. Had you relied upon our generosity for forgiveness and protection, an indulgence might have been granted; but under the disguise of virtue you concealed your crimes, and your necessities were hid beneath the mask of devotion.' These false aspersions roused in Julia the spirit of indignant virtue; she arose from her knees with an air of dignity,  that struck even the Abate. 'Holy father,' said she, 'my heart abhors the crime you mention, and disclaims all union with it. Whatever are my offences from the sin of hypocrisy I am at least free; and you will pardon me if I remind you, that my confidence has already been such, as fully justifies my claim to the protection I solicit. When I sheltered myself within these walls, it was to be presumed that they would protect me from injustice; and with what other term than injustice would you, Sir, distinguish the conduct of the marquis, if the fear of his power did not overcome the dictates of truth?' 	2.0	3.5	[1, 2, 0, 3]	VALID	1: Julia is accused of duplicity by a father figure, who threatens to deliver her to her father as punishment. She pleads for mercy and defends herself against the accusations.  2: The passage describes a conversation between Julia and the father figure. The conversation likely takes between 2 to 5 minutes.  3: The midpoint of the range is 3.5 minutes.  4: 3.5 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
13	RadcASR.txt|183|u	Her lover sinking back, endeavoured to conceal his emotions, but the deep sobs which agitated his breast, betrayed his anguish, and the tears of every spectator bedewed the sacred spot where beauty, sense, and innocence expired. The organ now swelled in mournful harmony; and the voices of the assembly chanted in choral strain, a low and solemn requiem to the spirit of the departed. Madame hurried Julia, who was almost as lifeless as her departed friend, from the church. A death so sudden, heightened the grief which separation  would otherwise have occasioned. It was the nature of Cornelia's disorder, to wear a changeful but flattering aspect. Though she had long been declining, her decay was so gradual and imperceptible, as to lull the apprehensions of her friends into security. It was otherwise with herself; she was conscious of the change, but forbore to afflict them with the knowledge of the truth. The hour of her dissolution was sudden, even to herself; but it was composed, and even happy. In the death of Cornelia Julia seemed to mourn again that of Hippolitus. Her decease appeared to dissolve the last tie which connected her with his memory. In one of the friars of the convent, Madame was surprized to find the father who had confessed the dying Vincent. 	60.0	45	[3, 1, 2, 0]	VALID	1: The passage describes a funeral scene where mourners grieve for a woman named Cornelia. Julia, a friend of the deceased, is deeply affected by the loss, and Madame tries to comfort her. The passage also mentions the gradual decline of Cornelia's health and her peaceful death.  2: The passage describes the funeral scene, which could take around 30 minutes to an hour. The mention of Cornelia's gradual decline could imply a period of weeks or months, but this should not be counted as time elapsed in the scene.  3: The funeral scene takes approximately 45 minutes (midpoint between 30 minutes and 1 hour).  4: 45 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
14	RadcASR.txt|220|u	At length the tumult began to subside, and Hippolitus could distinguish what was said. The ruffians agreed to give up the lady in question to him who  had fought for her; and leaving him to his prize, they all went out in quest of farther prey. The situation of the unfortunate lady excited a mixture of pity and indignation in Hippolitus, which for some time entirely occupied him; he revolved the means of extricating her from so deplorable a situation, and in these thoughts almost forgot his own danger. He now heard her sighs; and while his heart melted to the sounds, the farther door of the apartment was thrown open, and the wretch to whom she had been allotted, rushed in. Her screams now redoubled, but they were of no avail with the ruffian who had seized her in his arms; when the count, who was unarmed, insensible to every impulse but that of a generous pity, burst into the room, but became fixed like a statue when he beheld his Julia struggling in the grasp of the ruffian. On discovering Hippolitus, she made a sudden spring, and liberated herself; when,  running to him, she sunk lifeless in his arms. Surprize and fury sparkled in the eyes of the ruffian, and he turned with a savage desperation upon the count; who, relinquishing Julia, snatched up the sword of the dead ruffian, which lay upon the floor, and defended himself. 	10.0	3.5	[3, 0, 1, 2]	VALID	1: In this passage, Hippolitus listens to a group of ruffians arguing and then leaving. He then hears a lady's sighs and sees her struggling with a ruffian. He intervenes, and the lady, Julia, collapses in his arms. The ruffian then attacks Hippolitus, who defends himself with a sword.  2: The events described in the passage seem to happen quickly, with the ruffians arguing, leaving, and then the confrontation between Hippolitus, Julia, and the ruffian. This could take anywhere from 2 to 5 minutes.  3: The midpoint of the range is 3.5 minutes.  4: 3.5 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
15	RadcASR.txt|266|u	On the following morning Ferdinand returned with his friends to Palermo, where he first disclosed the late fatal events of the castle. They now settled their future plans; and Ferdinand hastened to the castle of Mazzini to fetch Emilia, and to give orders for the removal of his household to his palace at Naples, where he designed to fix his future residence. The distress of Emilia, whom he found recovered from her indisposition, yielded to joy and wonder, when she heard of the existence of her mother, and the safety of her sister. She departed with Ferdinand for Palermo, where her friends awaited her, and where the joy of the meeting was considerably heightened by the appearance  of Madame de Menon, for whom the marchioness had dispatched a messenger to St. Augustin's. Madame had quitted the abbey for another convent, to which however the messenger was directed. This happy party now embarked for Naples. From this period the castle of Mazzini, which had been the theatre of a dreadful catastrophe, and whose scenes would have revived in the minds of the chief personages connected with it, painful and shocking recollections was abandoned. On their arrival at Naples, Ferdinand presented to the king a clear and satisfactory account of the late events at the castle, in consequence of which the marchioness was confirmed in her rank, and Ferdinand was received as the sixth marquis de Mazzini. 	40320.0	4320	[3, 1, 0, 2]	VALID	1: The passage describes Ferdinand returning to Palermo, disclosing events, making plans, fetching Emilia, reuniting with friends, and embarking for Naples.  2: The events described likely take place over a few days, as Ferdinand travels, makes plans, and fetches Emilia. The passage also mentions the abandonment of the castle, which implies a longer period of time, but this is not directly described. We can estimate 2-4 days for the events in the passage. 3: The midpoint of the range is 3 days. At 24 hours a day, that's 72 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 4320 minutes. 4: 4320 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
16	RadcASR.txt|267|u	The marchioness, thus restored to the world, and to happiness, resided with her children in the palace at Naples, where, after time had somewhat  mellowed the remembrance of the late calamity, the nuptials of Hippolitus and Julia were celebrated. The recollection of the difficulties they had encountered, and of the distress they had endured for each other, now served only to heighten by contrast the happiness of the present period. Ferdinand soon after accepted a command in the Neapolitan army; and amidst the many heroes of that warlike and turbulent age, distinguished himself for his valour and ability. The occupations of war engaged his mind, while his heart was occupied in promoting the happiness of his family. Madame de Menon, whose generous attachment to the marchioness had been fully proved, found in the restoration of her friend a living witness of her marriage, and thus recovered those estates which had been unjustly with-held from her. But the marchioness and her family, grateful to her friendship, and attached  to her virtues, prevailed upon her to spend the remainder of her life at the palace of Mazzini. Emilia, wholly attached to her family, continued to reside with the marchioness, who saw her race renewed in the children of Hippolitus and Julia. Thus surrounded by her children and friends, and engaged in forming the minds of the infant generation, she seemed to forget that she had ever been otherwise than happy.' Here the manuscript annals conclude. In reviewing this story, we perceive a singular and striking instance of moral retribution. We learn also, that those who do only THAT WHICH IS RIGHT, endure nothing in misfortune but a trial of their virtue, and from trials well endured, derive the surest claim to the protection of heaven. FINIS.       	13140000.0	3942000	[0, 3, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The passage describes the happy resolution of a story, with characters finding love, success, and happiness after overcoming difficulties. 2: The passage describes a series of events that likely span several years, including a wedding, a military career, and the birth of children. It is difficult to pinpoint an exact duration, but it seems reasonable to estimate a range of 5 to 10 years. 3: The midpoint of the range is 7.5 years. Converting this to minutes: 7.5 years * 365 days/year * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 3,942,000 minutes. 4: 3,942,000 minutes. 5: Low confidence, due to the lack of specific time references and the need to estimate a range of years.

Now, while these memories and associations are fresh in my mind, wilt come with me, dear reader, to this sweet spot? wilt recline 'neath the sheltering branches of these noble trees? wilt place thy hand cordially in mine, and lend me thy sympathy and thy heart? and, while the birds are warbling their love songs over thy head, and the rainbow tinted fountain dashes its delicate and cooling spray about thy feet, — while the fleecy clouds rest lightly in the southern heavens, and the distant hum of the busy city, together with the far off murmuring of waters, lull thy senses to forgetfulness of care, — wilt listen to my simple tale? 1* 6 BOSTON COMMON. I was born in a little country village, not many hundred miles from the city of Boston. It is due to my parents to say something of them in this place. My father was an Englishman, of a proud old stock, who came from the county of Kent, England, to this country, many years before my birth. His father sent him to college, when quite young, to acquire a thorough classical education. He was destined for the bar; but, happening to meet with a pretty young lady soon after his entrance, he became unfortunately enamoured of her. I say unfortunately; for she had, in the eyes of the world, the great fault of being very poor in purse, although exceedingly beautiful in person. 	26280000.0	657000	[1, 2, 0, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator reminisces about Boston Common and their childhood in a village near Boston. They mention their father's background, including his education and meeting their mother. 2: The passage describes the narrator's memories and associations with Boston Common, which could span years, but the actual events described in the passage (the narrator's father's education and meeting their mother) likely took place over a few months to a couple of years. 3: Taking the midpoint of a few months to a couple of years, we can estimate 1.25 years. At 365 days a year, that's 456.25 days x 24 hours in a day, so 10950 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 657000 minutes. 4: 657000 minutes. 5: Low confidence, due to the speculative nature of the time estimate.

This tender epistle brought the old gentleman down very quickly to ascertain whom his darling Willie intended for the high honour of his hand; but when he found that the lady in question was a little nobody, who cut and made dresses for the proud dames of the village whenever they chose to patronise her, his rage knew no bounds. Ho anathematized her at once ; called her a ' saucy young baggage, ' a ' presuming upstart, ' c.; and, shaking his gold headed cane in the very face of Master William, bade him attend to his studies immediately, and to beware how he fell in love or troubled his father with such fooleries again. My grandfather then departed, in high good-humour with himself, thinking he had nipped a glorious rebellion in the bud, and conquered a young madcap of a son, who he forgot had the same unconquerable blood in his veins that flowed BOSTON COMMON. 7 through his own, and only waiting an occasion like the present to boil over. Young William was highly incensed at the insult, as ho called it, that his father had put upon him and his ladye love, and, with the fury and impetuosity of eighteen, flew to Helen's humble dwelling, and informed her, in glowing terms, of his father's language and resolution. 	30240.0	300	[0, 2, 1, 3]	VALID	1: A young man writes to his father asking for permission to marry Helen, a dressmaker.

The time it takes to write a letter and have a conversation could be around an hour. The father's travel time is not specified, but it seems to be relatively quick, so let's assume a few hours.

' My dearest Miss Graham, ' said the gentleman, coming forward to meet her, and leading her to a seat, ' how very happy I am to see you looking so well! I trembled, all the way, for fear you might be ill, or something.' He then, in low and thrilling language, poured into her ear the tale of his love, and ended by saying that she should be a second Helen to him, and that he would cherish and love her as fondly as ever man loved woman. Hettie was fascinated by the tones of the gentleman. His language, the first of the kind she had ever listened to, seemed like some beautiful music welling up from his heart; and, pleased as a child with toys at the novelty of her situation, she yielded a willing consent. The morrow's sun ushered in as bright and beautiful a day as one would wish to see. At ten o'clock precisely, the bride ' elect, dressed in her rich robes and looking charmingly beautiful, was handed into the carriage by her enamoured lover. Accompanied by her sister and a young gentleman acquaintance, they rode out to a little country village and were married.

Are you still sick, or do you wish to return, and see some one whom you left in Bardville? Come, cheer up, child, or I shall think you are in love; and I should feel sad enough to see you pining away on that account.' These words — said half in earnest, half in jest — set mo to thinking, and I did not wonder that my mother spoke of my appearance. I knew that I felt listless and unhappy, and must appear so. Even Kate Merton had noticed the change in me, without being able to account for it, for I guarded my half fledged love even from her friendly eyes. I therefore determined to conceal my feelings hereafter, and to assume my accustomed cheerfulness, and be as gay as possible. So I schooled my heart to obedience, dressed my face in smiles, and with my old appearance of happiness, soon put all suspicions at rest. About a fortnight after my return home, I one day received a letter from my lady friend in. Bardville. How eagerly did I grasp the little missive, and how dear did it seem to me, for it had come from the home of Roland!

21	FarrBC.txt|76|u	Her words conveyed both pleasure and pain to me; pleasure, that he, my heart's idol, had indeed come to live with us, and pain, that another should couple her name with his in that manner. I left her at her door, and pursued my way home, wondering what could have induced Hastings to come to Linden, and what could be his business here. I passed an almost sleepless night, and arose the next morning filled with happiness ; for the thought that he was going to live in Lin 76 BOSTON COMMON. den because it was my home, had taken entire possession of my mind, and was far too pleasing to be lightly rejected. As soon as breakfast was over, I sought Mary Listen, my friend of the day before, in the hope of gaining more information from her concerning Hastings. She soon began to speak of him, and, after expatiating a while upon his 'wondrous beauty', ' his ' floating hair, soul subduing eyes, ' c., told me that he bad come to Linden for the purpose of going into business with a gentleman. I saw that Mary was very much interested in the young man, but it did not cause me much trouble, for I folt quite willing to match my advantages with hers, any day. Poor Mary, how sad a fate was thine ! Thy memory comes to me through the long vista of years that have passed since thy death, and a sadness at thy untimely end creeps over my heart, and fills my eyes with tears of regret.

I am astonished, sir, that, knowing, as you must do, her preference for you, you can thus declare your love for another, and that other her intimate friend!' Elwyn Moore turned, and gave me such a reproachful look as made my heart grow sick. ' I thank you, Miss Clifton, ' 128 BOSTON COMMON. laid be, ' for your attention thus far. How much I regret your decision, I will not, dare not, say. Time alone will tell how much I suffer. I 'll not trouble you with it; but, my dear young lady, as for Letitia Milford, you need give yourself no uneasiness concerning her. She will outlive a dozen such ones as you or myself; and, after falling in love with every one who crosses her path, will at last settle down into a commonplace, sensible woman, with one, perhaps, whom she really loves.' 	2.0	3.5	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: In the passage, Mr. Moore confesses his love for Helen and asks her to reciprocate.

It seems to be a relatively quick exchange, likely taking between 2 to 5 minutes.  3: The midpoint of the range is 3.5 minutes.  4: 3.5 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence, as the conversation could be slightly shorter or longer depending on the pacing of their dialogue.

Harry mused a moment; then, looking at my pale and weary face, an expression of pain flitted over his own features. ' Have you been at your devotions lately, Helen ?' he asked. ' No, Harry, ' answered I, blushing. ' Since you talked with me, I have been absorbed in.my own selfish feelings, and am still, although ashamed to own it.' He looked down a moment, as if musing. 'If I only knew your sorrow, Helen, ' he said, ' I would strive to ameliorate it.' ' My grief admits of no amelioration, ' I replied. ' It lies too deep for mortal aid to reach; but consolation I must have, and immediately, or I will die.' ' Say not so, Helen, ' answered my cousin. ' Do not talk of dying, unless by God's holy will. Remember that He placed you here, and for his own purpose ; and if he afflicts you, it is that you may be brought nearer to him, and that you may seek comfort from him.

Listen, Helena, mine own, while I breathe it — Clarence Brook! Didst ever hear anything half so beautiful? It reminds me of the murmuring of brooks or the warbling of birds in summertime. It fell upon my enraptured ear like rich musie, and vibrated among my heartstrings long after I had heard it spoken!

Thomson. I awoke in the morning with an aching brow, and a painful sense of tightness about my chest, which increased to such a degree that a physician was called in before noon to administer relief. He shook his head, however, when he had examined my pulse, and, saying that my mind was troubled, left, without giving me any medicine. My uncle and aunt then sought my couch, and desired me to explain to them the cause of my illness. As their desires were commands with me, which I dared not disobey, I told them, in a choking voice, that I had the night before pledged myself to become the wife of Ernest Richmond; that I loved him not, but had been forced by him to make this promise. My kind friends were delighted! They embraced me very 18* 210 BOSTON COMMON. tenderly, and wished me all sorts of happiness, saying that I had fulfilled the darling wish of their hearts; that nothing could have given them greater pleasure; and that I was their own sensible child, after all! 	1152.0	900	[3, 2, 1, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator spends many hours in emotional turmoil, tries to sleep, wakes up feeling ill, and consults a physician. The narrator then tells their uncle and aunt about a forced engagement to Ernest Richmond. 2: The passage mentions 'many hours' of emotional turmoil, followed by an attempt to sleep, waking up in the morning, and a physician's visit before noon. This suggests a time frame of at least 12 hours, possibly up to 18 hours. 3: The midpoint of the range is 15 hours.

I was spellbound with admiration of the noble being, who stood, in all the beauty and glory of his manly strength, and pleaded so earnestly for his God. The remembrance of Roland, however, and his pale sad face, also my solemn vow of the evening before, rose in startling colours before me, and I found strength to reply. ' Ernest, ' said I, ' I cannot sign that paper; but I will sign one giving you my fortune, if you wish, for the purposes you have mentioned; but I cannot be your wife, for I am promised to another! ' I stopped, for my companion had arisen, and was gazing upon me with surprise. He made no comment, however, upon my last words, but said, with coldness and asperity, 268 BOSTON COMMON. ' Very well, Helen, you are at liberty to follow your own inclinations. I cannot bear to give you up, but, as you sincerely wish it, I release you for a while — remember, only for a while.

Ernest reacts with coldness and asperity but releases her for a while.  2: The passage describes a conversation between the narrator and Ernest. Conversations can vary in length, but given the emotional intensity and the amount of dialogue, it likely took between 2 to 5 minutes.  3: The midpoint of the range is 3.5 minutes.  4: 3.5 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence, as the conversation's length is estimated based on the content and emotional intensity.

She gazed with admiration at the lofty trees, and was never weary of wandering through the shady paths, or of watching the beautiful fountain, as it fell, with many graceful evolutions, to the basin of the pond, or dashed its cool, rainbow coloured spray about our feet. At length we found ourselves at home once more, and, wearied with our long journey, were not sorry for the opportunity of resting a while. Letitia was quite overjoyed to 28 BOSTON COMMON. see us again, and went into some of her old raptures over us ; which I overlooked on this occasion, and, kissing the little Helen, who had grown very finely, expressed my pleasure in seeing them both looking so well and happy. ' 0 yes, Helen, ' said Mrs. Roscoe, ' I am perfectly content, and shall be delighted to spend my life with you in this dear retreat; for I have found that peace and comfort here which it was impossible to obtain elsewhere.' And so it seemed; for Letitia did not trouble herself much about anything beyond her chamber. She busied herself in taking care of her child, to whom she seemed exceedingly attached, and in reading a parcel of novels she had brought from the Alleghanies. 	1440.0	75	[3, 1, 2, 0]	VALID	1: Kate and the narrator return from a walk on the Common, admire the scenery, and reunite with Letitia and her child Helen. Letitia expresses her contentment with her life in their current location.  2: The passage describes a walk on the Common, which could take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours.

I seated myself at his feet, and, laying my head in his lap, talked to him of the blessings we still possessed in our beautiful home, our noble boy, and in our love for each other. I was afraid of saying a word which might cause him to repent the new step he had taken, and so I never reverted to the past. I told him stories of men who had conquered themselves, who had learned to rule their own spirits, who had struggled with mighty temptations and come out victorious. And then our conversations would revert to Willie, and we would resolve to set an example of purity and goodness before our child, to guard him from evil, and to inculcate lessons of virtue into his heart. He listened to all these stories, and agreed with me concerning the child. I could not have believed that I should have felt so much consolation.

Do not delay; but go, in Heaven's name ! ' ' And you ? ' he said, anxiously. ' Never mind me, but go immediately, ' said I. Mr. Merriman had a kind heart; and, turning to a large, red faced man, he said, ' Mr. Douglas, take care of this lady until I return ; and do not let her venture out of doors alone, by any means, for she will surely perish.

' 0, Helen ! how can you ? ' ' It's a fact. For instance: last evening you sat in a corner of the sofa with him more than two hours. Ernest, Edward, and Mabel, had gone out; Willie was asleep ; and there sat your cherished friend Helen, with not a soul to speak to, for those long, long hours. ' Well, I bore it as long as I could, and then resolved, lover or no lover, boldly to stand up for my own rights. With all my bravery, however, my resolution failed me as I approached the sofa. After considering a moment, as all wise people do, I plucked up the courage to speak. ' My dear Katherine, ' said I, in the sweetest of voices, ' will you lend me your Henriade a. few moments ?' My words were very soft, and my request quite modest; but I might as well have BOSTON COMMON. 485 spoken to the winds, for you paid not the slightest heed to me. I repeated my question; but still you heard me not. I then thought of some other plan; so I turned, suddenly, and tipped over a chair at the other corner of the room.

Helen complains about being ignored by Kate when she is with the man and recounts an incident from the previous evening.  2: The conversation itself might take a few minutes, but Helen refers to an incident from the previous evening that lasted more than two hours. Since the conversation is the main focus of the passage, we can estimate that the passage describes a few minutes plus the two hours from the previous evening.  3: Taking the midpoint of a few minutes (let's say 3 minutes) and adding it to the two hours from the previous evening, we have 2 hours and 3 minutes. Multiplying 2 hours by 60 minutes per hour, we get 120 minutes. Adding the 3 minutes, we have 123 minutes.  4: 123 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.

I was wearing my powder-blue suit, with dark blue shirt, tie and display handkerchief, black brogues, black wool socks with dark blue clocks on them. I was neat, clean, shaved and sober, and I didn't care who knew it. I was everything the well-dressed private detective ought to be. I was calling on four million dollars.  The main hallway of the Sternwood place was two stories high. Over the entrance doors, which would have let in a troop of Indian elephants, there was a broad stained-glass panel showing a knight in dark armor rescuing a lady who was tied to a tree and didn't have any clothes on but some very long and convenient hair. The knight had pushed the vizor of his helmet back to be sociable, and he was fiddling with the knots on the ropes that tied the lady to the tree and not getting anywhere. I stood there and thought that if I lived in the house, I would sooner or later have to climb up there and help him. He didn't seem to be really trying. 	1.0	10	[1, 3, 2, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator, a private detective, arrives at a wealthy client's house on a mid-October morning and describes his attire and the entrance of the house. 2: The passage describes the detective's arrival at the house, which could take anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes, considering the time spent observing the stained-glass panel. 3: The midpoint of the range is 10 minutes. 4: 10 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

Beyond the garage were some decorative trees trimmed as carefully as poodle dogs. Beyond them a large greenhouse with a domed roof. Then more trees and beyond everything the solid, uneven, comfortable line of the foothills.  On the east side of the hall a free staircase, tile-paved, rose to a gallery with a wrought-iron railing and another piece of stained-glass romance. Large hard chairs with rounded red plush seats were backed into the vacant spaces of the wall round about. They didn't look as if anybody had ever sat in them. In the middle of the west wall there was a big empty fireplace with a brass screen in four hinged panels, and over the fireplace a marble mantel with cupids at the corners. Above the mantel there was a large oil portrait, and above the portrait two bullet-torn or moth-eaten cavalry pennants crossed in a glass frame. The portrait was a stiffly posed job of an officer in full regimentals of about the time of the Mexican war. The officer had a neat black imperial, black mustachios, hot hard coal-black eyes, and the general look of a man it would pay to get along with. I thought this might be General Sternwood's grandfather. It could hardly be the General himself, even though I had heard he was pretty far gone in years to have a couple of daughters still in the dangerous twenties. 	1.0	7.5	[0, 2, 1, 3]	VALID	1: The passage describes the interior and exterior of a hall, including a portrait of an officer, and the surrounding landscape. 2: The passage is mostly descriptive, with no explicit reference to time. However, the description of the chauffeur dusting the car and the mention of the officer's portrait from around the time of the Mexican War imply some passage of time. The time it takes to observe these details could be around 5 to 10 minutes. 3: The midpoint of the range is 7.5 minutes. 4: 7.5 minutes. 5: Low confidence, as the passage is mostly descriptive and does not focus on specific events or actions.

Then the old man dragged his voice up from the bottom of a well and said: “Brandy, Norris. How do you like your brandy, sir?”  “Any way at all,” I said.  The butler went away among the abominable plants. The General spoke again, slowly, using his strength as carefully as an out-of-work show-girl uses her last good pair of stockings.  “I used to like mine with champagne. The champagne as cold as Valley Forge and about a third of a glass of brandy beneath it. You may take your coat off, sir. It's too hot in here for a man with blood in his veins.”  I stood up and peeled off my coat and got a handkerchief out and mopped my face and neck and the backs of my wrists. St. Louis in August had nothing on that place. I sat down again and I felt automatically for a cigarette and then stopped. The old man caught the gesture and smiled faintly.  “You may smoke, sir. I like the smell of tobacco.”  I lit the cigarette and blew a lungful at him and he sniffed at it like a terrier at a rathole. The faint smile pulled at the shadowed corners of his mouth. 	2.0	3.5	[0, 3, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator meets an old man, sits down, takes off his coat, and lights a cigarette while they discuss how they like their brandy. 2: The actions described are relatively quick: sitting down, taking off a coat, and lighting a cigarette. This could take anywhere from 2 to 5 minutes. 3: The midpoint of the range is 3.5 minutes. 4: 3.5 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

She took a swallow from it and gave me a cool level stare over the rim of the glass.  “So you're a private detective,” she said. “I didn't know they really existed, except in books. Or else they were greasy little men snooping around hotels.”  There was nothing in that for me, so I let it drift with the current. She put her glass down on the flat arm of the chaise-longue and flashed an emerald and touched her hair. She said slowly: “How did you like Dad?”  “I liked him,” I said.  “He liked Rusty. I suppose you know who Rusty is?”  “Uh-huh.”  “Rusty was earthy and vulgar at times, but he was very real. And he was a lot of fun for Dad. Rusty shouldn't have gone off like that. Dad feels very badly about it, although he won't say so. Or did he?”  “He said something about it.”  “You're not much of a gusher, are you, Mr. Marlowe? But he wants to find him, doesn't he?”  I stared at her politely through a pause. “Yes and no,” I said. 	1.0	2	[1, 0, 3, 2]	VALID	1: A woman and a private detective have a conversation about her father and a man named Rusty. 2: The conversation is brief and consists of a few exchanges.

37	thebigsleep.txt|22|u	     FOUR  A. G. Geiger's place was a store frontage on the north side of the boulevard near Las Palmas. The entrance door was set far back in the middle and there was a copper trim on the windows, which were backed with Chinese screens, so I couldn't see into the store. There was a lot of oriental junk in the windows. I didn't know whether it was any good, not being a collector of antiques, except unpaid bills. The entrance door was plate glass, but I couldn't see much through that either, because the store was very dim. A building entrance adjoined it on one side and on the other was a glittering credit jewelry establishment. The jeweler stood in his entrance, teetering on his heels and looking bored, a tall handsome white-haired Jew in lean dark clothes, with about nine carats of diamond on his right hand. A faint knowing smile curved his lips when I turned into Geiger's store. I let the door close softly behind me and walked on a thick blue rug that paved the floor from wall to wall. There were blue leather easy chairs with smoke stands beside them. A few sets of tooled leather bindings were set out on narrow polished tables, between book ends. There were more tooled bindings in glass cases on the walls. Nice-looking merchandise, the kind a rich promoter would buy by the yard and have somebody paste his bookplate in. At the back there was a grained wood partition with a door in the middle of it, shut. In the corner made by the partition and one wall a woman sat behind a small desk with a carved wooden lantern on it. 	1.0	2	[1, 3, 0, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator enters an antique store, observes the dimly lit interior, and notices a woman sitting behind a small desk in the corner. 2: The passage describes the narrator's entrance and observations, which would likely take around 1 to 3 minutes. 3: The midpoint of the range is 2 minutes. 4: 2 minutes. 5: High confidence.

The local law in your pocket and a well-greased line into L.A. In other words, protection. Geiger was in a racket that needed that too. Perhaps you spared him a little now and then, seeing he's your tenant.”  His mouth became a hard white grimace. “Geiger was in what racket?”  “The smut book racket.”  He stared at me for a long level minute. “Somebody got to him,” he said softly. “You know something about it. He didn't show at the store today. They don't know where he is. He didn't answer the phone here. I came up to see about it. I find blood on the floor, under a rug. And you and a girl here.”  “A little weak,” I said. “But maybe you can sell the story to a willing buyer. You missed a little something, though. Somebody moved his books out of the store today—the nice books he rented out.”  He snapped his fingers sharply and said: “I should have thought of that, soldier. You seem to get around. How do you figure it?”  “I think Geiger was rubbed. I think that is his blood. And the books being moved out gives a motive for hiding the body for a while. Somebody is taking over the racket and wants a little time to organize.”  “They can't get away with it,” Eddie Mars said grimly. 	3.0	3.5	[0, 1, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator and Eddie Mars discuss Geiger's disappearance, the blood found on the floor, and the removal of books from Geiger's store. They speculate about the motive behind these events. 2: The passage describes a conversation between the narrator and Eddie Mars.

39	thebigsleep.txt|126|u	His breath made a soft hissing sound in the quiet room. He said very quietly: “You haven't had to tell any of my men where to put their feet, smart guy.”  “We'll see about that,” Ohls said. “This chauffeur I spoke of that's drowned off Lido shot a guy last night in your territory. A guy named Geiger who ran a dirty book racket in a store on Hollywood Boulevard. Geiger was living with the punk I got outside in my car. I mean living with him, if you get the idea.”  Cronjager was staring at him levelly now. “That sounds like it might grow up to be a dirty story,” he said.  “It's my experience most police stories are,” Ohls growled and turned to me, his eyebrows bristling. “You're on the air, Marlowe. Give it to him.”  I gave it to him.  I left out two things, not knowing just why, at the moment, I left out one of them. I left out Carmen's visit to Brody's apartment and Eddie Mars' visit to Geiger's in the afternoon. I told the rest of it just as it happened.  Cronjager never took his eyes off my face and no expression of any kind crossed his as I talked. At the end of it he was perfectly silent for a long minute. Wilde was silent, sipping his coffee, puffing gently at his dappled cigar. Ohls stared at one of his thumbs. 	7.0	7.5	[2, 3, 1, 0]	VALID	1: In the passage, characters discuss a crime and its connections to other people. The protagonist, Marlowe, tells the story of what happened, leaving out two details.  2: The passage describes a conversation, with Marlowe telling a story. Conversations can vary in length, but this one seems to be relatively brief. Let's estimate it took between 5 and 10 minutes.  3: The midpoint of the range is 7.5 minutes.  4: 7.5 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence, as the conversation length is an estimate.
40	thebigsleep.txt|138|u	 I read all three of the morning papers over my eggs and bacon the next morning. Their accounts of the affair came as close to the truth as newspaper stories usually come—as close as Mars is to Saturn. None of the three connected Owen Taylor, driver of the Lido Pier Suicide Car, with the Laurel Canyon Exotic Bungalow Slaying. None of them mentioned the Sternwoods, Bernie Ohls or me. Owen Taylor was “chauffeur to a wealthy family.” Captain Cronjager of the Hollywood Division got all the credit for solving the two slayings in his district, which were supposed to arise out of a dispute over the proceeds from a wire service maintained by one Geiger in the back of the bookstore on Hollywood Boulevard. Brody had shot Geiger and Carol Lundgren had shot Brody in revenge. Police were holding Carol Lundgren in custody. He had confessed. He had a bad record—probably in high school. Police were also holding one Agnes Lozelle, Geiger's secretary, as a material witness.  It was a nice write-up. It gave the impression that Geiger had been killed the night before, that Brody had been killed about an hour later, and that Captain Cronjager had solved both murders while lighting a cigarette. The suicide of Taylor made Page One of Section II. There was a photo of the sedan on the deck of the power lighter, with the license plate blacked out, and something covered with a cloth lying on the deck beside the running board. Owen Taylor had been despondent and in poor health. His family lived in Dubuque, and his body would be shipped there. There would be no inquest. 	60.0	22.5	[1, 2, 0, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator reads three morning newspapers the next day, which report on various crimes and their investigations, including two murders and a suicide. 2: The passage describes the narrator reading the newspapers over breakfast, which could take around 15 to 30 minutes. 3: The midpoint of the range is 22.5 minutes. 4: 22.5 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
41	thebigsleep.txt|161|u	 “Something the matter, Mrs. Regan?”  She turned her face to him with a sort of lunge. I saw the curve of her cheek stiffen, as if with an almost unbearable inner tautness. She didn't answer him.  Eddie Mars said gravely: “If you're not playing any more, you must let me send someone home with you.”  The girl flushed. Her cheekbones stood out white in her face. Then she laughed off-key. She said bitterly:  “One more play, Eddie. Everything I have on the red. I like red. It's the color of blood.”  Eddie Mars smiled faintly, then nodded and reached into his inner breast pocket. He drew out a large pinseal wallet with gold corners and tossed it carelessly along the table to the croupier. “Cover her bet in even thousands,” he said, “if no one objects to this turn of the wheel being just for the lady.”  No one objected, Vivian Regan leaned down and pushed all her winnings savagely with both hands on to the large red diamond on the layout.  The croupier leaned over the table without haste. He counted and stacked her money and chips, placed all but a few chips and bills in a neat pile and pushed the rest back off the layout with his rake. He opened Eddie Mars' wallet and drew out two flat packets of thousand-dollar bills. He broke one, counted six bills out, added them to the unbroken packet, put the four loose bills in the wallet and laid it aside as carelessly as if it had been a packet of matches. Eddie Mars didn't touch the wallet. Nobody moved except the croupier. He spun the wheel left-handed and sent the ivory ball skittering along the upper edge with a casual flirt of his wrist. Then he drew his hands back and folded his arms. 	2.0	4	[2, 3, 1, 0]	VALID	1: In this passage, a woman named Mrs. Regan is gambling at a roulette table. Eddie Mars, the casino owner, offers to send someone home with her if she's not playing anymore. She decides to bet everything on red, and the croupier spins the wheel.  2: The events described in the passage include a brief conversation, the woman placing her bet, the croupier counting and stacking the money, spinning the wheel, and sending the ball along the edge. These actions would likely take around 3 to 5 minutes.  3: The midpoint of the range is 4 minutes.  4: 4 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
42	thebigsleep.txt|164|u	 I waited, behind the tree.      TWENTY-THREE  Light steps, the steps of a woman, came along the invisible pathway and the man in front of me moved forward and seemed to lean against the fog. I couldn't see the woman, then I could see her indistinctly. The arrogant carriage of her head seemed familiar. The man stepped out very quickly. The two figures blended in the fog, seemed to be part of the fog. There was dead silence for a moment. Then the man said:  “This is a gun, lady. Gentle now. Sound carries in the fog. Just hand me the bag.”  The girl didn't make a sound. I moved forward a step. Quite suddenly I could see the foggy fuzz on the man's hat brim. The girl stood motionless. Then her breathing began to make a rasping sound, like a small file on soft wood.  “Yell,” the man said, “and I'll cut you in half.”  She didn't yell. She didn't move. There was a movement from him, and a dry chuckle. “It better be in here,” he said. A catch clicked and a fumbling sound came to me. The man turned and came towards my tree. When he had taken three or four steps he chuckled again. The chuckle was something out of my own memories. I reached a pipe out of my pocket and held it like a gun. 	4.0	2	[0, 2, 1, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator waits behind a tree and observes a man threatening a woman to hand over her bag. The narrator then prepares to confront the man with a pipe held like a gun. 2: The events described in the passage are quick: the woman's approach, the man's threat, and the narrator's decision to intervene. This likely takes between 1 to 3 minutes. 3: The midpoint of the range is 2 minutes. 4: 2 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
44	thebigsleep.txt|198|u	 I thought about it most of the day. Nobody came into the office. Nobody called me on the phone. It kept on raining.      TWENTY-SIX  At seven the rain had stopped for a breathing spell, but the gutters were still flooded. On Santa Monica the water was level with the sidewalk and a thin film of it washed over the top of the curbing. A traffic cop in shining black rubber from boots to cap sloshed through the flood on his way from the shelter of a sodden awning. My rubber heels slithered on the sidewalk as I turned into the narrow lobby of the Fulwider Building. A single drop light burned far back, beyond an open, once gilt elevator. There was a tarnished and well-missed spittoon on a gnawed rubber mat. A case of false teeth hung on the mustard-colored wall like a fuse box in a screen porch. I shook the rain off my hat and looked at the building directory beside the case of teeth. Numbers with names and numbers without names. Plenty of vacancies or plenty of tenants who wished to remain anonymous. Painless dentists, shyster detective agencies, small sick businesses that had crawled there to die, mail order schools that would teach you how to become a railroad clerk or a radio technician or a screen writer—if the postal inspectors didn't catch up with them first. A nasty building. A building in which the smell of stale cigar butts would be the cleanest odor. 	1440.0	1452.5	[0, 3, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator spends a day in the office with no visitors or calls, then goes to the Fulwider Building in the rain, where they observe the rundown surroundings and building directory. 2: The passage describes a day spent in the office, followed by the narrator's visit to the Fulwider Building. The time spent in the office is not explicitly described, but the visit to the building likely takes around 10-15 minutes. 3: Taking the midpoint of the range (12.5 minutes) for the visit to the building and adding the day spent in the office (24 hours), we have a total of 24 hours and 12.5 minutes. Converting this to minutes, we have (24 * 60) + 12.5 = 1440 + 12.5 = 1452.5 minutes. 4: 1452.5 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
45	thebigsleep.txt|199|u	 An old man dozed in the elevator, on a ramshackle stool, with a burst-out cushion under him. His mouth was open, his veined temples glistened in the weak light. He wore a blue uniform coat that fitted him the way a stall fits a horse. Under that gray trousers with frayed cuffs, white cotton socks and black kid shoes, one of which was slit across a bunion. On the stool he slept miserably, waiting for a customer. I went past him softly, the clandestine air of the building prompting me, found the fire door and pulled it open. The fire stairs hadn't been swept in a month. Bums had slept on them, eaten on them, left crusts and fragments of greasy newspaper, matches, a gutted imitation-leather pocketbook. In a shadowy angle against the scribbled wall a pouched ring of pale rubber had fallen and had not been disturbed. A very nice building.  I came out at the fourth floor sniffing for air. The hallway had the same dirty spittoon and frayed mat, the same mustard walls, the same memories of low tide. I went down the line and turned a corner. The name: “L. D. Walgreen—Insurance,” showed on a dark pebbled glass door, on a second dark door, on a third behind which there was a light. One of the dark doors said: “Entrance.”  A glass transom was open above the lighted door. Through it the sharp bird-like voice of Harry Jones spoke, saying:  “Canino? . . . Yeah, I've seen you around somewhere. Sure.”  I froze. The other voice spoke. It had a heavy purr, like a small dynamo behind a brick wall. It said: “I thought you would.” There was a vaguely sinister note in that voice. 	2.0	4	[3, 1, 2, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator enters a building, passes a sleeping old man, walks up the stairs, and reaches the fourth floor. He then hears a conversation between two people, Harry Jones and another person with a heavy purr-like voice. 2: The time it takes to enter the building, walk up the stairs, and reach the fourth floor could be around 3 to 5 minutes. 3: The midpoint of the range is 4 minutes. 4: 4 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
46	thebigsleep.txt|211|u	They turned off on this road and Joe swung around and went back and we saw the car turn off the road where the frame house was. We sat there half an hour looking through the cars going by. Nobody came back out. When it was quite dark Joe sneaked up there and took a look. He said there were lights in the house and a radio was going and just the one car out in front, the coupe. So we beat it.”  She stopped talking and I listened to the swish of tires on Wilshire. I said: “They might have shifted quarters since then but that's what you have to sell—that's what you have to sell. Sure you knew her?”  “If you ever see her, you won't make a mistake the second time. Good-bye, copper, and wish me luck. I got a raw deal.”  “Like hell you did,” I said, and walked away across the street to my own car.  The gray Plymouth moved forward, gathered speed, and darted around the corner onto Sunset Place. The sound of its motor died, and with it blonde Agnes wiped herself off the slate for good, so far as I was concerned. Three men dead, Geiger, Brody and Harry Jones, and the woman went riding off in the rain with my two hundred in her bag and not a mark on her. I kicked my starter and drove on downtown to eat. I ate a good dinner. Forty miles in the rain is a hike, and I hoped to make it a round trip. 	60.0	52.5	[0, 3, 1, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator and Joe watch a house for half an hour, then the narrator talks to a woman named Agnes, who drives away.

Does Norris know?” “He'll never tell.” “I thought he knew.” I went quickly away from her down the room and out and down the tiled staircase to the front hall. I didn't see anybody when I left. I found my hat alone this time. Outside the bright gardens had a haunted look, as though small wild eyes were watching me from behind the bushes, as though the sunshine itself had a mysterious something in its light. I got into my car and drove off down the hill.	3.0	3.5	[2, 3, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator decides to confront Eddie after getting some rest, despite the warning that Eddie might try to kill him.

You were dead, you were sleeping the big sleep, you were not bothered by things like that. Oil and water were the same as wind and air to you. You just slept the big sleep, not caring about the nastiness of how you died or where you fell. Me, I was part of the nastiness now. Far more a part of it than Rusty Regan was. But the old man didn't have to be. He could lie quiet in his canopied bed, with his bloodless hands folded on the sheet, waiting. His heart was a brief, uncertain murmur. His thoughts were as gray as ashes. And in a little while he too, like Rusty Regan, would be sleeping the big sleep.    On the way downtown I stopped at a bar and had a couple of double Scotches. They didn't do me any good. All they did was make me think of Silver-Wig, and I never saw her again. 	60.0	15	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator reflects on death and the idea of 'sleeping the big sleep,' then stops at a bar to have a couple of double Scotches before thinking about a woman named Silver-Wig. 2: The passage describes the narrator's thoughts on death, which could take a few minutes, and then stopping at a bar to have a couple of double Scotches, which could take around 10 to 20 minutes. 3: Let's estimate that the total time elapsed is 15 minutes (5 minutes for thinking and 10 minutes for drinking). 4: 15 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
49	ElliRI.txt|0|u	Prologue   I am an invisible man. No, I am not a spook like those who haunted Edgar Allan Poe; nor am I one of your Hollywood-movie ectoplasms. I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and liquids—and I might even be said to possess a mind. I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me. Like the bodiless heads you see sometimes in circus sideshows, it is as though I have been surrounded by mirrors of hard, distorting glass. When they approach me they see only my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their imagination—indeed, everything and anything except me.  Nor is my invisibility exactly a matter of a biochemical accident to my epidermis. That invisibility to which I refer occurs because of a peculiar disposition of the eyes of those with whom I come in contact. A matter of the construction of their inner eyes, those eyes with which they look through their physical eyes upon reality. I am not complaining, nor am I protesting either. It is sometimes advantageous to be unseen, although it is most often rather wearing on the nerves. Then too, you're constantly being bumped against by those of poor vision. Or again, you often doubt if you really exist. You wonder whether you aren't simply a phantom in other people's minds. Say, a figure in a nightmare which the sleeper tries with all his strength to destroy. It's when you feel like this that, out of resentment, you begin to bump people back. And, let me confess, you feel that way most of the time. You ache with the need to convince yourself that you do exist in the real world, that you're a part of all the sound and anguish, and you strike out with your fists, you curse and you swear to make them recognize you. And, alas, it's seldom successful. 	13140000.0	5	[2, 1, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator introduces themselves as an invisible man, not due to a physical condition, but because people refuse to see them. They discuss the challenges and occasional advantages of being unseen.  2: The passage is a reflection on the narrator's state of invisibility and their feelings about it. There is no explicit reference to time, but the narrator's thoughts and feelings could be expressed in a matter of minutes.  3: Let's assume the narrator's thoughts take about 5 minutes to express.  4: 5 minutes.  5: Low confidence, as there is no explicit reference to time and the estimate is based on speculation.
50	ElliRI.txt|1|u	 One night I accidentally bumped into a man, and perhaps because of the near darkness he saw me and called me an insulting name. I sprang at him, seized his coat lapels and demanded that he apologize. He was a tall blond man, and as my face came close to his he looked insolently out of his blue eyes and cursed me, his breath hot in my face as he struggled. I pulled his chin down sharp upon the crown of my head, butting him as I had seen the West Indians do, and I felt his flesh tear and the blood gush out, and I yelled, “Apologize! Apologize!” But he continued to curse and struggle, and I butted him again and again until he went down heavily, on his knees, profusely bleeding. I kicked him repeatedly, in a frenzy because he still uttered insults though his lips were frothy with blood. Oh yes, I kicked him! And in my outrage I got out my knife and prepared to slit his throat, right there beneath the lamplight in the deserted street, holding him in the collar with one hand, and opening the knife with my teeth—when it occurred to me that the man had not seen me, actually; that he, as far as he knew, was in the midst of a walking nightmare! And I stopped the blade, slicing the air as I pushed him away, letting him fall back to the street.	3.0	3.5	[1, 3, 2, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator bumps into a man in the dark, who insults him.

Since slavery times!”  “That's true, sir. And the white family that owned the land when it was a big plantation still lives in town.”  “Yes,” he said, “I know that many of the old families still survive. And individuals too, the human stock goes on, even though it degenerates. But these cabins!” He seemed surprised and confounded.  “Do you suppose those women know anything about the age and history of the place? The older one looks as though she might.”  “I doubt it, sir. They—they don't seem very bright.”  “Bright?” he said, removing his cigar. “You mean that they wouldn't talk with me?” he asked suspiciously.  “Yes, sir. That's it.”  “Why not?”  I didn't want to explain. It made me feel ashamed, but he sensed that I knew something and pressed me.  “It's not very nice, sir. But I don't think those women would talk to us.”  “We can explain that we're from the school. Surely they'll talk then. You may tell them who I am.”  “Yes, sir,” I said, “but they hate us up at the school. They never come there …”  “What!”  “No, sir.”  “And those children along the fence down there?”  “They don't either, sir.”  “But why?”  “I don't really know, sir. Quite a few folks out this way don't, though. I guess they're too ignorant. They're not interested.”  “But I can't believe it.”  The children had stopped playing and now looked silently at the car, their arms behind their backs and their new oversized overalls pulled tight over their little pot bellies as though they too were pregnant. 	2.0	3.5	[3, 0, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The passage involves a conversation between two people discussing the age and history of some cabins built during slavery times. They also discuss the reluctance of the local people to interact with them or the school they represent.  2: The conversation seems to be continuous, with no significant pauses or breaks.

52	ElliRI.txt|120|u	 “Hurry, the man is as insane as the rest,” Mr. Norton said.  “Yes, sir,” I said, noticing a new note in his voice.  The balcony was now as noisy as the floor below. The girls and drunken vets were stumbling about with drinks in their hands. Just as we went past an open door Edna saw us and grabbed my arm.  “Where you taking white-folks?” she demanded.  “Back to school,” I said, shaking her off.  “You don't want to go up there, white-folks, baby,” she said. I tried to push past her. “I ain't lying,” she said. “I'm the best little home-maker in the business.”  “Okay, but please let us alone,” I pleaded. “You'll get me into trouble.”  We were going down the stairs into the milling men now and she started to scream, “Pay me then! If he's too good for me, let him pay!”  And before I could stop her she had pushed Mr. Norton, and both of us were stumbling swiftly down the stairs. I landed against a man who looked up with the anonymous familiarity of a drunk and shoved me hard away. I saw Mr. Norton spin past as I sank farther into the crowd. Somewhere I could hear the girl screaming and Halley's voice yelling, “Hey! Hey! Hey, now!” Then I was aware of fresh air and saw that I was near the door and pushed my way free and stood panting and preparing to plunge back for Mr. Norton—when I heard Halley calling, “Make way y'all!” and saw him piloting Mr. Norton to the door. 	1.6	4	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator is trying to escort Mr. Norton through a chaotic scene with drunken people and a persistent woman named Edna. They stumble down the stairs and get separated, but eventually, Halley helps Mr. Norton get to the door.  2: The events described in the passage seem to happen quickly, with the characters moving through the crowd and down the stairs. It's reasonable to estimate that the events took about 3 to 5 minutes.  3: The midpoint of the range is 4 minutes.  4: 4 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
53	ElliRI.txt|170|u	 Uttering apologies, Dr. Bledsoe helped him to his chair. Then as the old man rested back with a smile, Dr. Bledsoe walked to the edge of the platform and lifted his arms. I closed my eyes as I heard the deep moaning sound that issued from him, and the rising crescendo of the student body joining in. This time it was music sincerely felt, not rendered for the guests, but for themselves; a song of hope and exaltation. I wanted to rush from the building, but didn't dare. I sat stiff and erect, supported by the hard bench, relying upon it as upon a form of hope.  I could not look at Dr. Bledsoe now, because old Barbee had made me both feel my guilt and accept it. For although I had not intended it, any act that endangered the continuity of the dream was an act of treason.  I did not listen to the next speaker, a tall white man who kept dabbing at his eyes with a handkerchief and repeating his phrases in an emotional and inarticulate manner. Then the orchestra played excerpts from Dvořák's New World Symphony and I kept hearing “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot” resounding through its dominant theme—my mother's and grandfather's favorite spiritual. It was more than I could stand, and before the next speaker could begin I hurried past the disapproving eyes of teachers and matrons, out into the night. 	30.0	15	[2, 3, 1, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator listens to Dr. Bledsoe and the student body sing, feels guilty, and doesn't pay attention to the next speaker. The orchestra plays, and the narrator leaves the event. 2: The passage describes the singing, a speech, and an orchestral performance. These events would likely take around 10-20 minutes. 3: The midpoint of the range is 15 minutes. 4: 15 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
54	ElliRI.txt|233|u	 “Yes. That's a way of putting it. Because to help you I must disillusion you …”  “Oh, I don't think I mind, sir. Once I see Mr. Emerson, it'll be up to me. All I want to do is speak to him.”  “Speak to him,” he said, getting quickly to his feet and mashing his cigarette into the tray with shaking fingers. “No one speaks to him. He does the speaking—” Suddenly he broke off. “On second thought, perhaps you'd better leave me your address and I'll mail you Mr. Emerson's reply in the morning. He's really a very busy man.”  His whole manner had changed.  “But you said …” I stood up, completely confused. Was he having fun with me? “Couldn't you let me talk to him for just five minutes?” I pleaded. “I'm sure I can convince him that I'm worthy of a job. And if there's someone who has tampered with my letter, I'll prove my identity … Dr. Bledsoe would—”  “Identity! My God! Who has any identity anymore anyway? It isn't so perfectly simple. Look,” he said with an anguished gesture. “Will you trust me?”  “Why, yes, sir, I trust you.”  He leaned forward. “Look,” he said, his face working violently, “I was trying to tell you that I know many things about you—not you personally, but fellows like you. Not much, either, but still more than the average. With us it's still Jim and Huck Finn.	1.4	3.5	[2, 1, 0, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator is speaking with a man who seems to be trying to help him meet Mr. Emerson. The man initially agrees but then changes his mind, suggesting that he will mail Mr. Emerson's reply instead.  2: The conversation between the narrator and the man takes place in real-time, with no explicit reference to time. However, it seems like a relatively short conversation, likely taking between 2 to 5 minutes.  3: The midpoint of the range is 3.5 minutes.  4: 3.5 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
55	ElliRI.txt|263|u	 Running the rag over a gauge I wondered how an apparently uneducated old man could gain such a responsible job. He certainly didn't sound like an engineer; yet he alone was on duty. And you could never be sure, for at home an old man employed as a janitor at the Water Works was the only one who knew the location of all of the water mains. He had been employed at the beginning, before any records were kept, and actually functioned as an engineer though he drew a janitor's pay. Perhaps this old Brockway was protecting himself from something. After all, there was antagonism to our being employed. Maybe he was dissimulating, like some of the teachers at the college, who, to avoid trouble when driving through the small surrounding towns, wore chauffeur caps and pretended that their cars belonged to white men. But why was he pretending with me? And what was his job?  I looked around me. It was not just an engine room; I knew, for I had been in several, the last at college. It was something more. For one thing, the furnaces were made differently and the flames that flared through the cracks of the fire chambers were too intense and too blue. And there were the odors. No, he was making something down here, something that had to do with paint, and probably something too filthy and dangerous for white men to be willing to do even for money. It was not paint because I had been told that the paint was made on the floors above, where, passing through, I had seen men in splattered aprons working over large vats filled with whirling pigment. One thing was certain: I had to be careful with this crazy Brockway; he didn't like my being here … And there he was, entering the room now from the stairs. 	1.2	10	[1, 2, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator is in an engine room with an old man named Brockway, trying to understand his role and the purpose of the room. The narrator observes the room and its differences from other engine rooms, speculating about what is being made there. 2: The passage describes the narrator's thoughts and observations, which could take anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes. 3: The midpoint of the range is 10 minutes. 4: 10 minutes. 5: Low confidence, due to the speculative nature of the time estimate.
56	ElliRI.txt|266|u	 “Oh, sho, sho,” he said. “Sho. But you better take a rest when you git tired.”  I didn't stop. I piled on the material until he said, “That there's the scoop we been trying to find. That's what we want. You better stand back a little, 'cause I'm fixing to start her up.”  I backed away, watching him go over and push a switch. Shuddering into motion, the machine gave a sudden scream like a circular saw, and sent a tattoo of sharp crystals against my face. I moved clumsily away, seeing Brockway grin like a dried prune. Then with the dying hum of the furiously whirling drums, I heard the grains sifting lazily in the sudden stillness, sliding sand-like down the chute into the pot underneath.  I watched him go over and open a valve. A sharp new smell of oil arose.  “Now she's all set to cook down; all we got to do is put the fire to her,” he said, pressing a button on something that looked like the burner of an oil furnace. There was an angry hum, followed by a slight explosion that caused something to rattle, and I could hear a low roaring begin.  “Know what that's going to be when it's cooked?”  “No, sir,” I said. 	2.0	7.5	[0, 1, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator is learning how to operate a machine from Brockway, who instructs him to pile on material, start the machine, and then set it to cook down. 2: The events described include piling material onto the machine, starting it, and setting it to cook. This process likely takes a few minutes, perhaps 5 to 10 minutes. 3: The midpoint of the range is 7.5 minutes. 4: 7.5 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
57	ElliRI.txt|334|u	 “Hon, Hon,” he said, placing his hand on her shoulder. “It's the agent, not these gentlemen. He's the one. He says it's in the bank, but you know he's the one. We've done business with him for over twenty years.”  “Don't tell me,” she said. “It's all the white folks, not just one. They all against us. Every stinking low-down one of them.”  “She's right!” a hoarse voice said. “She's right! They all is!”  Something had been working fiercely inside me, and for a moment I had forgotten the rest of the crowd. Now I recognized a self-consciousness about them, as though they, we, were ashamed to witness the eviction, as though we were all unwilling intruders upon some shameful event; and thus we were careful not to touch or stare too hard at the effects that lined the curb; for we were witnesses of what we did not wish to see, though curious, fascinated, despite our shame, and through it all the old female, mind-plunging crying.  I looked at the old people, feeling my eyes burn, my throat tighten. The old woman's sobbing was having a strange effect upon me—as when a child, seeing the tears of its parents, is moved by both fear and sympathy to cry. I turned away, feeling myself being drawn to the old couple by a warm, dark, rising whirlpool of emotion which I feared. I was wary of what the sight of them crying there on the sidewalk was making me begin to feel. I wanted to leave, but was too ashamed to leave, was rapidly becoming too much a part of it to leave. 	0.7497	7.5	[0, 2, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The passage describes a scene where an older couple is being evicted from their home, and the narrator is observing the situation, feeling a mix of emotions and shame.  2: The passage describes the narrator's thoughts and emotions, as well as the dialogue between the older couple and the crowd. The events described likely take place within a few minutes, perhaps 5 to 10 minutes.  3: The midpoint of the range is 7.5 minutes.  4: 7.5 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence, as the passage focuses more on the narrator's emotions and thoughts rather than specific actions or events.
58	ElliRI.txt|375|u	 “How about a drink for us, Emma?” Brother Jack said.  “Well, now, I'll have to think about it,” she said, tilting her severely drawn head and smiling.  “Don't think, act,” he said. “We're very thirsty men. This young man pushed history ahead twenty years today.”  “Oh,” she said, her eyes becoming intent. “You must tell me about him.”  “Just read the morning papers, Emma. Things have begun to move. Yes, leap ahead.” He laughed deeply.  “What would you like, Brother?” she said, her eyes brushing slowly over my face.  “Bourbon,” I said, a little too loudly, as I remembered the best the South had to offer. My face was warm, but I returned her glance as steadily as I dared. It was not the harsh uninterested-in-you-as-a-human-being stare that I'd known in the South, the kind that swept over a black man as though he were a horse or an insect; it was something more, a direct, what-type-of-mere-man-have-we-here kind of look that seemed to go beneath my skin … Somewhere in my leg a muscle twitched violently.  “Emma, the bourbon! Two bourbons,” Brother Jack said. 	1.2	2	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The characters discuss getting a drink, with Brother Jack praising the protagonist for his actions. Emma looks at the protagonist intently, and he feels her gaze is different from what he experienced in the South. Brother Jack orders two bourbons.  2: The conversation and actions in the passage are brief and seem to occur in real-time. It likely takes about 1 to 3 minutes for the dialogue and actions to unfold.  3: The midpoint of the range is 2 minutes.  4: 2 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
59	ElliRI.txt|499|u	 “Brothers, please,” Brother Jack said. “One at a time. What do you know about this article?” he said to me.  “Not very much,” I said. “The editor of the magazine called to say he was sending a reporter up for an interview. The reporter asked a few questions and took a few pictures with a little camera. That's all I know.”  “Did you give the reporter a prepared handout?”  “I gave her nothing except a few pieces of our official literature. I told her neither what to ask me nor what to write. I naturally tried to co-operate. If an article about me would help make friends for the movement I felt it was my duty.”  “Brothers, this thing was arranged,” Wrestrum said. “I tell you this opportunist had that reporter sent up there. He had her sent up and he told her what to write.”  “That's a contemptible lie,” I said. “You were present and you know I tried to get them to interview Brother Clifton!”  “Who's a lie?”  “You're a liar and a fat-mouthed scoundrel. You're a liar and no brother of mine.”  “Now he's calling me names. Brothers, you heard him.”  “Let's not lose our tempers,” Brother Jack said calmly. “Brother Wrestrum, you've made serious charges. Can you prove them?”  “I can prove them. All you have to do is read the magazine and prove them for yourself.”  “It will be read.	2.0	3.5	[2, 1, 3, 0]	VALID	1: In the passage, a group of people is discussing an article. Brother Jack asks the protagonist about his involvement with the article, and the protagonist explains that he only gave the reporter official literature. Wrestrum accuses the protagonist of arranging the article, leading to a heated exchange.  2: The passage describes a conversation between several people. Conversations like this typically take a few minutes. Let's estimate between 2 and 5 minutes.  3: The midpoint of the range is 3.5 minutes.  4: 3.5 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
60	ElliRI.txt|519|u	 If they don't call by four o'clock, I'm saved, I told myself. But still no sign, not even a call to a meeting. Finally I rang her number, hearing her voice, delighted, gay and discreet; but no mention of the night or the man. And hearing her so composed and gay I was too embarrassed to bring it up. Perhaps this was the sophisticated and civilized way? Perhaps he was there and they had an understanding, a woman with full rights.  Would I return for further discussion, she wanted to know.  “Yes, of course,” I said.  “Oh, Brother,” she said.  I hung up with a mixture of relief and anxiety, unable to shrug off the notion that I had been tested and had failed. I went through the next week puzzling over it, and even more confused because I knew nothing definite of where I stood. I tried to detect any changes in my relations with Brother Jack and the others, but they gave no sign. And even if they had, I wouldn't have known its definite meaning, for it might have had to do with the charges. I was caught between guilt and innocence, so that now they seemed one and the same. My nerves were in a state of constant tension, my face took on a stiff, noncommittal expression, beginning to look like Brother Jack's and the other leaders'. Then I relaxed a bit; work had to be done and I would play the waiting game.	10080.0	10800	[0, 3, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator anxiously waits for a call, finally calls a woman, and has a conversation with her. He spends the next week puzzled and anxious, trying to detect changes in his relationships with others.  2: The passage describes the narrator waiting for a call until 4 o'clock, making a phone call, and then going through the next week. So, the time elapsed is a little over a week.  3: A little over a week has elapsed. At seven days a week, that's approximately 7.5 days. 24 hours in a day, so 180 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 10,800 minutes.  4: 10,800 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
61	ElliRI.txt|528|u	 Barrelhouse had prepared me for the darkened windows of the district, but not, when I let myself in, to call in vain through the dark to Brother Tarp. I went to the room where he slept, but he was not there; then I went through the dark hall to my old office and threw myself into my desk chair, exhausted. Everything seemed to be slipping away from me and I could find no quick absorbing action that would get it under control. I tried to think of whom among the district committee I might call for information concerning Clifton, but here again I was balked. For if I selected one who believed that I had requested to be transferred because I hated my own people it would only complicate matters. No doubt there would be some who'd resent my return, so it was best to confront them all at once without giving any one of them the opportunity to organize any sentiment against me. It was best that I talk with Brother Tarp, whom I trusted. When he came in he could give me an idea of the state of affairs, and perhaps tell me what had actually happened to Clifton. 	7.0	7.5	[0, 2, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator returns to a darkened district, searches for Brother Tarp, and reflects on the situation and the need to talk to Brother Tarp for information about Clifton and the state of affairs. 2: The narrator enters the building, searches for Brother Tarp, and sits down to think. This sequence of events would likely take around 5 to 10 minutes. 3: The midpoint of the range is 7.5 minutes. 4: 7.5 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
62	ElliRI.txt|547|u	Men out of time, who would soon be gone and forgotten … But who knew (and now I began to tremble so violently I had to lean against a refuse can)—who knew but that they were the saviors, the true leaders, the bearers of something precious? The stewards of something uncomfortable, burdensome, which they hated because, living outside the realm of history, there was no one to applaud their value and they themselves failed to understand it. What if Brother Jack were wrong? What if history was a gambler, instead of a force in a laboratory experiment, and the boys his ace in the hole? What if history was not a reasonable citizen, but a madman full of paranoid guile and these boys his agents, his big surprise! His own revenge? For they were outside, in the dark with Sambo, the dancing paper doll; taking it on the lambo with my fallen brother, Tod Clifton (Tod, Tod) running and dodging the forces of history instead of making a dominating stand.  A train came. I followed them inside. There were many seats and the three sat together. I stood, holding onto the center pole, looking down the length of the car. On one side I saw a white nun in black telling her beads, and standing before the door across the aisle there was another dressed completely in white, the exact duplicate of the other except that she was black and her black feet bare. Neither of the nuns was looking at the other but at their crucifixes, and suddenly I laughed and a verse I'd heard long ago at the Golden Day paraphrased itself in my mind:  Bread and Wine,  Bread and Wine,  Your cross ain't nearly so  Heavy as mine …    And the nuns rode on with lowered heads. 	9.0	5	[3, 0, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator observes men who seem out of place in history and ponders their significance. He then boards a train, sees two nuns, and recalls a verse from the past. 2: The passage describes the narrator's thoughts and observations, which could take place within a few minutes. Boarding the train and observing the nuns might take around 5 minutes. 3: 5 minutes have elapsed. 4: 5 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
63	ElliRI.txt|721|u	 In going underground, I whipped it all except the mind, the mind. And the mind that has conceived a plan of living must never lose sight of the chaos against which that pattern was conceived. That goes for societies as well as for individuals. Thus, having tried to give pattern to the chaos which lives within the pattern of your certainties, I must come out, I must emerge. And there's still a conflict within me: With Louis Armstrong one half of me says, “Open the window and let the foul air out,” while the other says, “It was good green corn before the harvest.” Of course Louis was kidding, he wouldn't have thrown old Bad Air out, because it would have broken up the music and the dance, when it was the good music that came from the bell of old Bad Air's horn that counted. Old Bad Air is still around with his music and his dancing and his diversity, and I'll be up and around with mine. And, as I said before, a decision has been made. I'm shaking off the old skin and I'll leave it here in the hole. I'm coming out, no less invisible without it, but coming out nevertheless. And I suppose it's damn well time. Even hibernations can be overdone, come to think of it. Perhaps that's my greatest social crime, I've overstayed my hibernation, since there's a possibility that even an invisible man has a socially responsible role to play. 	2628000.0	194400	[1, 2, 0, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator reflects on his time spent underground and the need to emerge, acknowledging the conflict within him and the importance of playing a socially responsible role.  2: The passage does not provide explicit time references for the events described. However, the narrator mentions hibernation, which implies a significant period of time spent underground. Hibernation typically lasts for months, so we can estimate a range of 3 to 6 months.  3: The midpoint of the range is 4.5 months. Converting this to minutes: 4.5 months x 30 days/month x 24 hours/day x 60 minutes/hour = 194,400 minutes.  4: 194,400 minutes.  5: Low confidence, due to the lack of explicit time references and the need to estimate based on the concept of hibernation.
64	ElliRI.txt|722|u	 “Ah,” I can hear you say, “so it was all a build-up to bore us with his buggy jiving. He only wanted us to listen to him rave!” But only partially true: Being invisible and without substance, a disembodied voice, as it were, what else could I do? What else but try to tell you what was really happening when your eyes were looking through? And it is this which frightens me:  Who knows but that, on the lower frequencies, I speak for you? 	0	0.75	[1, 2, 0, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator, who is invisible, addresses the reader, explaining that they only wanted to share their perspective and wonders if they might speak for the reader on some level.  2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage, and the events described are minimal. The narrator's speech could have taken around 30 seconds to 1 minute.  3: The midpoint of the range is 45 seconds. Converting seconds to minutes, we have 0.75 minutes.  4: 0.75 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
65	SwarGT.txt|0|u	1   REQUIESCAT   WICKENBURG — Mrs. Jeanette Champie, 93, Arizona pioneer, died Tuesday in Phoenix. Born in Comfort, Texas, Mrs. Champie moved to Arizona in 1888 with her husband, the late A.F. Champie, with whom she celebrated their 62nd wedding anniversary in 1945. Mr. Champie was a mining man and the couple resided in several Yavapai County mining towns until they moved to Wickenburg. Mrs. Champie's early days in the Arizona Territory were laced with harrowing experiences. She was often forced to cope with raiding Indians. Once she shot a mountain lion out of a tree directly above her while her young children gathered about her in terror.      2   WHEN   This nation's history is the richer because a few of our forefathers had the gumption and literacy to put down on paper a day-to-day chronicle of their adventures as they bustled our frontier westward. Such accounts are invaluable. They spank life and breath into the past. We treasure them in family Bibles, in library collections of Americana, and in print. But there has taken place in the last twenty years the most incredible mass traipse from East to West that any country has ever known. It is The Great American Sashay. From Grand Forks to Norfolk, from Skowhegan to Shreveport, hordes of New Pioneers have hit the trail in search of whatever they have lost, or what they never found. U-Drive-It trains of superhighway settlers have peopled The Fancy Dress Frontier of the 1950's and 1960's. Who will record for the future their vicissitudes and victories? Who will tell this chromium-plated Eastern Western story? 	10512000.0	1.5	[2, 3, 1, 0]	VALID	1: The passage begins with an obituary of an Arizona pioneer woman, then transitions to a reflection on the importance of recording history, especially the mass migration from East to West in the 1950s and 1960s. 2: The passage mentions the woman's life, which spans 93 years, and the mass migration, which spans 20 years. However, these are not events described in the passage, but rather historical context. The passage itself does not describe any events taking place, so we can estimate that the time elapsed is minimal, perhaps a minute or two, as it takes to read the passage. 3: 1.5 minutes have elapsed. 4: 1.5 minutes. 5: High confidence.
66	SwarGT.txt|1|u	 I nominate myself, H. Carleton Cadell, husband and father, yokel and intellectual, late of Old Wycherley, Connecticut, and better late than ever.  Call me a Cadillac cowboy if you will. The Grand Central Station Gang, my former fellow-riders on the New York, New Haven & Hartford stage line, insult me, so I hear, with labels similarly choice. “Billy the Button-Down Kid,” they scoff, or “The T.S. Eliot Tenderfoot” or “Wyatt Earp with an Attache Case.”  Let them have their jest. Archetype of the dude I may be, but I have gone west now, where men are men and where, when you say such things, stranger, you smile.  It was books, not a six-gun, which sent me packing, which made of me a dilettante Don Quixote gone daft from reading. For some time after marriage I pretended industry by commuting now and then from our estate to New York, to the Public Library, and there for several hours doing research for a possible Ph.D. in history. By chance I crossed a Mississippi of the mind and commenced to graze with rising appetite in a territory of Indians and ranchers and cavalry and gunflghters and romance from whence I was never emotionally to return. As a historian I had found my era, as a man my place. Stooped, spindle-shanked, thick-lensed, balding pedant—not I! In this bony breast there snorted a bison, there swaggered a roistering mountain man, there was born, a civilization too late, a stripling Teddy Roosevelt hot for deeds of derring-do! 	1576800.0	64800	[2, 0, 1, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator, H. Carleton Cadell, describes himself as a former intellectual from Connecticut who has gone west and become enamored with the cowboy lifestyle, driven by his love for books about the Wild West.  2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but it does describe the narrator's transition from an intellectual in Connecticut to a cowboy enthusiast in the West. This transition could have taken weeks or months, but the passage focuses on the change in the narrator's mindset rather than the actual time it took. We can estimate that the events described would have taken a few weeks to a few months.  3: Taking the midpoint of the range (a few weeks to a few months), we can estimate around 1.5 months. At 30 days a month, that's 45 days. 24 hours in a day, so 1080 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 64800 minutes.  4: 64800 minutes.  5: Low confidence, due to the lack of explicit time references and the focus on the narrator's mindset rather than the actual time it took for the transition.
67	SwarGT.txt|21|u	Boyd.”  “An' you jes' call me Eddie Bud.”      6   PARTNER   I was hard put to let even a polite interval pass before seeking out Eddie Bud Boyd. I had come, in a sense, three thousand miles to meet, to accredit, indeed to bard this man! The second day, therefore, after the heavy hors d'oeuvres party and the rescue of the deer, I hit the trail on foot across several acres of desert and up to Fast Draw Drive, a new street on which, it gradually dawned on me, there was but one house, the scandal of Temptation Valley, the only one the Boyds could possibly have bought! Everyone called it the “Trader Vic” house, and in fact, with its rococo-Polynesian roof lines, its violent coral siding, its spear-and-grass ornamentation, its full-sized prau, or dugout canoe, hanging in the carport, it did resemble a restaurant rather than a residence. Perched vertiginously on a ledge of rock above two other homes and priced at $250,000, it had gone buyerless for over a year and been the subject of debate about whether or not anyone in possession of any faculties could ever be suckered into such an eyesore. Someone had been. A mailbox in the shape of a coconut named the victim as “E.B. Boyd.”  Like Captain Cook I made my way through a farrow of delivery trucks and landscapers lowering eucalyptus and cacti into holes and under a fronded entry through the front door, which was open. What I entered was a movie set, not a living room. The ceiling was thatched with palm fronds. 	2880.0	12.5	[0, 1, 2, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator visits Eddie Bud Boyd's house, which is a unique and controversial building in the neighborhood. The narrator enters the house and describes the living room as resembling a movie set.  2: The passage describes the narrator's journey to Eddie Bud Boyd's house, which likely takes a few minutes to walk across several acres of desert and up to Fast Draw Drive. There is no explicit reference to time, but we can estimate the time it takes to walk the distance and enter the house.  3: Let's estimate that it takes about 10 to 15 minutes to walk the distance and enter the house. The midpoint of this range is 12.5 minutes.  4: 12.5 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
68	SwarGT.txt|38|u	“Sorry,” I smiled, “but we've had to draw the line. You understand, I'm sure. We let one anachronism in and they'll all want in.”  “No, Carleton, not for the golf! It's so we'd have us a place t' go an' t' meet folks an' have frien's. It's so we'd b'long t' somethin' in town. Please, Carleton?”  Suddenly a breeze cleared the smoke from his burnished, youthful countenance. I looked into eyes as trusting and supplicant as a captive deer's. For once in my life I met innocence cornea to cornea. The word has been debased. I mean innocence such as we associate with rosebuds, with babes in mangers, with graves and Grecian urns, with harps on high, with the most distant dewy dawnings of the earth. I mean innocence of such depth and rarity and truth that my heart literally turned within me, recoiled in shame that I had dared even for a moment to doubt its presence.  “Yes, Eddie Bud, I'll get you in the club, I'll help you, I'll do everything!” I said, the words springing from my mouth like frogs. “You didn't even have to ask!”  “Ah do thank you, Carleton. How come?”  “Because you're the genuine, indubitable article,” I said. “Because in you the past still lives. Because in you I find all those qualities which have made the American character unique—daring, innocence, democracy, gusto, humor, cussedness, generosity, industry, vision, independence, horse sense, ingenuity, grit, sociability.” I swallowed the lump in my throat. 	1.0	4	[1, 0, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator speaks with a man named Eddie Bud, who wants to join a club. The narrator initially refuses but then changes his mind after seeing Eddie Bud's innocence and genuine qualities.  2: The passage describes a conversation between the narrator and Eddie Bud. There is no explicit reference to time, but the conversation and the narrator's internal thoughts would likely take a few minutes. We can estimate between 3 to 5 minutes.  3: The midpoint of the range is 4 minutes.  4: 4 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.

So overwhelmed was I by admiration and love for the man, by sheer natal joy in him, by recognitions and revelations which had come too swiftly, that I rushed from the room, undergoing as I left the house the raven gaze of his small, mustachioed retainer. “Adios, Titano!” I cried. Answer came there none.      7   REQUIESCAT    CEDAR CREEK—In a simple tribal service, R-25, believed to be the last of the numbered Apaches, was buried here yesterday on the reservation where he lived for seventy-six years. His real name was Oga Altaha, but he was given the R-25 designation by Gen. George Crook many years ago when the old U.S. Cavalry identified the Apaches by serial numbers. Under clear skies and in a biting wind R-25 was carried to the cemetery in a plain pickup truck. Following tribal custom, the casket was buried facing east so he may always greet the rising sun. The Apaches believe strongly in immortality, so food, clothing, and a small jug of water were placed in Oga Altaha's grave to insure comfort on the long journey to the hereafter.      8   HOW    Married money is best. About inherited wealth one must be modest, while that earned has invariably a sweaty odor; but riches gained by marriage are like manna fallen from Heaven. Devour them, I say, and damn the stomach acids. 	1.0	30	[2, 1, 0, 3]	VALID	1: The passage begins with two characters becoming partners, followed by a description of R-25's funeral, and ends with a reflection on the merits of marrying into wealth. 2: The passage describes three separate events: the partnership, the funeral, and the reflection on marrying into wealth. The partnership scene could take a few minutes, the funeral could take around an hour, and the reflection on marrying into wealth could take a few minutes. So, the range is from a few minutes to an hour. 3: The midpoint of the range is approximately 30 minutes. 4: 30 minutes. 5: Low confidence, due to the separate events and lack of explicit time references.
70	SwarGT.txt|48|u	 We may not believe with John Wesley that cleanliness is next to godliness, but we are secretly assured that altitude is next to beatitude.  “In the legends of the saints and prophets,” writes Krutch, my Socrates, “either a desert or a mountain is pretty sure to figure. It is either in the middle of one or on the top of the other that the vision comes or the test is met.” Conceive my dismay, then, this morning when, my feet on the desk, in a posture and state conducive to vision, the furniture, the very walls of the house commenced to vibrate, and there lunked into sight through my window an immense bulldozer. It rooted and snorted, raping, obviously, of the immaculate desert, a new street. I left the house and striding across the terrain shouted at the operator to cease and desist at once. He could not hear. Just as I snatched up a chunk of quartz to hurl at him, a jeep, following the machine, pulled up, and the driver introduced himself as Walt Duppa, the developer, he was proud to state, of Sarcophagus Shadows. He unrolled a plat. Sarcophagus Shadows was the eighty acres around us, running clear to the mountaintop; he had just bought it, he proposed to grade and pave streets, bring in utilities, and to get thirty building sites out of it. Progress, he said.  He wore a Foreign Legion kepi. Sternly I inquired if he needed the money? 	7.0	7.5	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator is disturbed by a bulldozer outside their window, goes out to confront the operator, and meets the developer, Walt Duppa, who explains his plans for the area. 2: The narrator's actions, from observing the bulldozer to confronting the operator and talking to the developer, likely took around 5 to 10 minutes. 3: The midpoint of the range is 7.5 minutes. 4: 7.5 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

You ain't picked up thet check by the time we're gone, it's your funeral.”  “Funeral?”  At the word's implication the showroom went deathly still. The very air seemed to crackle with conflict. Two employees, a secretary and a mechanic, scurried out of range.  “Boyd,” the dealer said slowly, “theah's some things a man'll do an' some he won't.”  “Huckabee,” replied the cattleman softly, “he wants t' stay in business he will.”  The situation was irreversibly reversed. Amicable strangers only moments ago, buyer and seller were now combatants in a stylized, commercial showdown. They backed off from one another. Each seemed to assume his own version of the classic stance, the dealer slightly crouched, arms loose, right hand just below hip lever, the cattleman more erect, his budding belly flattened.  “You pushin' me, Boyd.”  “Make your play, Huckabee.”  Under the wide hat brims, level, lethal stare met level lethal stare. Which would falter first, which would first betray? I edged behind the sedan. The drama was breathtaking, heroical, in the most genetic American tradition!  Suddenly, with a superb indifference, Boyd deliberately turned his back and strode out the door!  I hurried after him.  Wordless, we settled ourselves in the Buick. 	2.5	10	[2, 1, 3, 0]	VALID	1: In the passage, a tense negotiation takes place between a cattleman and a car dealer. The cattleman writes a check and tells the dealer to accept it or face consequences. The situation escalates into a standoff, and then the cattleman leaves the showroom, with the narrator following him.  2: The events described in the passage include a conversation, a tense standoff, and the cattleman leaving the showroom. This could take anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes.  3: The midpoint of the range is 10 minutes.  4: 10 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
72	SwarGT.txt|84|u	 He had just started the engine when a hand appeared through the window.  “You win, partner. l'll get them two cars ready t' roll.”  They shook. Bill Huckabee retired. The entire transaction had been completed in ten minutes.  I was not too sapped by tension to applaud. “Eddie Bud, you were simply great!”  “Like takin' candy from a baby.”  “No! It was a real coup de Cadillac!” But as we waited to take delivery of the automobiles, arithmetic triumphed over my emotion. “Ten thousand dollars,” I mused, “just like that.”  “Damn good deal. Carleton, if a thing's bought right, it's half sold.”  I was not reassured. To the $10,000 I added the $6000 for Titano's searchlight and the $150,000 for the Trader Vic monstrosity, which had yet to be furnished, plus the $14,000 for the pool and the $1000 for saddles. The total, for a few weeks, was appalling. He had indeed come to town, and I had authenticated him, but apparently my functions, while chiefly tutorial, must also include those of spiritual guardian. I must help him buckle on his guns against temptation; I must stand at his side in the shoot-out with Profligacy. 	1.0	10	[1, 2, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator and Eddie Bud complete a transaction to buy two cars in ten minutes, and the narrator reflects on the large amount of money spent in a short period of time. 2: The passage explicitly states that the transaction took ten minutes. The narrator's reflection on the money spent in a few weeks is not a description of events, so it should not be counted as time elapsed in the passage. 3: 10 minutes have elapsed. 4: 10 minutes. 5: High confidence.
73	SwarGT.txt|87|u	     22   WHOA    When our cattleman made his bride the love-gift of a new automobile he set off, quite literally, a concatenation of catastrophes from which there was to be no respite for weeks. Fortunately I was not present, nor would I have been morbid enough to question him, but his attorneys have provided me with a few of the details.  Recall that his home clings to the side of Sarcophagus Mountain. Situated in direct vertical line on the slope below are two other mansions owned, one would have assumed, by affluent and forgiving neighbors. These let us designate Houses #1 and #2. Recall, too, that on the verge of physical and nervous collapse I had staggered to my own domicile. What then ensued we may reconstruct as follows.  Forth he led the trembling Christabel, enthroning her behind the wheel of the convertible. In excess of pride he ordered her to take it around the block. She could not even start it. This he did for her, and showed her how to shift into drive. To the accelerator she put bare foot. In her behalf, let it be entered here that the unworldly girl had never before driven a vehicle more sophisticated than a pickup truck. Faced with automatic shift, power brakes, power steering, power windows, power seat, power top, and an array of other controls as intricate as those for guidance in space, she was helpless. Evidently she pulled and pushed everything. Perhaps it was the wrong bit for the beast, perhaps a burr under its saddle. “Whoa!” she screamed. But this was a steed foaled in Detroit, not in Colorado's high country. The Cadillac bucked forward, then flinging gravel leaped across their acreage to a rendezvous with the law of gravity. 	15.0	7.5	[0, 2, 1, 3]	VALID	1: A cattleman gifts his bride a new automobile, and she attempts to drive it for the first time. She struggles with the controls and accidentally sends the car careening forward.  2: The passage describes the cattleman showing his bride the car, her attempting to start it, him starting it for her, and her accidentally accelerating. This sequence of events would likely take around 5 to 10 minutes.  3: The midpoint of the range is 7.5 minutes.  4: 7.5 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
74	SwarGT.txt|91|u	 Further proof of the trials the flesh is heir to on the Fancy Dress Frontier. During my absence on the circuit, Dorene and Suzanne began riding lessons from a wrangler at a nearby resort, whose honorarium is $10 per hour. They also joined, bless their girlish hearts, a riding club located ten miles away, and this necessitated the purchase of a two-horse van, which in turn required a custom hitch for the rear bumper of the Bentley, which was scarcely designed for the hauling of horses. Thinking to ensalad the cuisine of their pets, moreover, the girls the other day fed them day-old clippings from the lawn piled up by our yard man. These had fermented. Pandora and Niobe have come down with colic, a malady characterized, according to my dictionary, by “Paroxysmal pain in the abdomen.” With agony they whinny. The veterinary arrives every hour on the hour.      23   PROPHET    Fate, fate. To rough it from Connecticut to Arizona seeking a new reverence for birds and beasts and botany, new significations of beneficence and spirituality among men, only to set oneself unwittingly down smack-dab in the middle of a real-estate development. Sarcophagus Shadows is a-building. For weeks the dynamiters have blasted troughs in rock for gas and water mains as wild creatures fled across my pleasance in panic, dispossessed forever of their hearths. For weeks the paving crews have rolled and rumbled and stunk.	40320.0	30240	[2, 3, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator describes the expenses and complications of his family's horse-riding activities, and laments the construction of a real-estate development near his home. 2: The passage describes events that have occurred over a period of weeks, such as the riding lessons, the purchase of a van, and the construction of the real-estate development. The veterinary visits are mentioned as happening every hour, but it's unclear how many hours this has been going on. We can estimate the time described in the passage to be between 2 to 4 weeks. 3: Taking the midpoint of the range, we have 3 weeks. At 7 days a week, that's 21 days x 24 hours in a day, so 504 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 30,240 minutes. 4: 30,240 minutes. 5: Low confidence, due to the uncertainty of the exact duration of the events described.
75	SwarGT.txt|102|u	Yes, Christabel had learned how to drive the convertible. Yes, let's have another round. Yes, all the devastation she had done on the mountainside had been paid for without resort to litigation, including a fresh brace of Katangan cockatoos. “Honey, you ever see so many pilgrims in your life?” “Once. Time ah went t' Denver.” “At a movie picture?” “No. Theah was a fire.”  The lobby filled. The elite of Phoenix hung from the decor. An orchestra struck up and out. The lights dimmed, leaving only the runway in glare. To applause, the internationally renowned couturier to the internationally renowned, notorious Pierre Mannique, made an entrance to commentate his new collection, jetted out only that afternoon from his Fifth Avenue boutique.  Pierre informed us that alors, mesdames et messieurs, zis was ze year of ze “Bonbon Look.” To begin, he would illustrate with hats. The first model slithered down the runway with a bonbon of velvet crushed into her coif, to be followed by bonbons of silk, leather, and fur. Then came frocks, coats, ball gowns. Mannique was the real bonbon. A flit of the flittiest sort, his giggles were shrill, his hands darty as bats, and his accent seemed to me to have in it a soupcon of St. Paul-Minneapolis in addition to the Faubourg St.-Honore. Reba was interested. The Boyds were riveted. Neither of them had ever dreamed the sex might be so lavishly titivated. With side glances at his wife's second-hand apparel, Eddie Bud dealt rapidly from his stack of scrip.	10.0	10080	[0, 3, 1, 2]	VALID	1: Christabel has learned to drive a convertible and paid for damages she caused. The scene then shifts to a crowded lobby where a fashion show is taking place, featuring designer Pierre Mannique and his 'Bonbon Look.' The Boyds are fascinated by the extravagant clothing.  2: The passage begins with a reference to Christabel learning to drive and paying for damages, which could have taken days or weeks. However, the main focus of the passage is the fashion show, which would likely last for an hour or two. We can estimate that the events described in the passage span a few days to a couple of weeks.  3: Taking the midpoint of the range, we can estimate that the events span about 1 week. At seven days a week, that's 7 days x 24 hours in a day, so 168 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 10,080 minutes.  4: 10,080 minutes.  5: Low confidence, due to the uncertainty in the time it took for Christabel to learn to drive and pay for damages.

Ciao, chaps.”  Our flight back across the haunted, patient reservation was like that of two thugs with their loot. “We hit us the jackpot, partner! They're baled up like cotton, them rugs, but what ah could see, they're pretty as money in the bank!”  Eddie Bud said once, but did not speak again until we junctioned with U.S. 66 on the outskirts of Flagstaff, where he pulled off onto the concrete apron by an all-night gasoline station. It was light here, he said, and there was something he wanted to see. First he'd borrow some wire cutters from the attendant. I waited in the pickup. It was midnight. Cars horneted past monotonously on U.S. 66, families sleeping inside, worldly goods jammed into trailers, all heading west, to California I hoped. Above me, north of Flagstaff, twelve-thousand-foot peaks ruminated. It was depressing to reflect that most of the beautiful, wooded acreage on their slopes belong not to the nation but to syndicates of movie stars. The commission man returned with a tool and climbed into the bed of the pickup.  There was sound and movement, then nothing. After several minutes I got out. Eddie Bud sat slumped. The wires around the bale were cut, and uncompressed rugs were strewn and scattered. 	150.0	102	[1, 0, 2, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator and Jackson drive back from a reservation with a bale of rugs. They stop at a gas station, where Jackson cuts the wires around the bale and examines the rugs.  2: The passage describes a drive back from the reservation and a stop at a gas station. The drive could take anywhere from 30 minutes to a couple of hours. The stop at the gas station, including the time spent cutting the wires and examining the rugs, might take around 10 to 15 minutes.  3: Assuming the drive takes 1.5 hours (the midpoint of the range) and the stop takes 12.5 minutes (the midpoint of the range), the total time elapsed is 1.7 hours. Multiplying by 60 minutes an hour, that's 102 minutes.  4: 102 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
77	SwarGT.txt|170|u	 I think it not without pertinence to recall that President Taft, having been harassed by the settlers out here to such personal purgatory that he admitted them to statehood, not long afterward registered his unyielding opposition to capital punishment—except in the case of Arizonans.      47   BAGATELLE    “Light of my life,” I said to Reba, “consider this a mere bagatelle. In the good old days Apache braves were wont to snick off the tips of their wives' noses at the slightest provocation, even infidelity.”  But she was not to be humored out of it. She marched to the laundry room, there to bandage and console a bruised Annie, even to do the ironing in her stead. John Hochee, out of work and temperish, last night it seems laid hands on some firewater and then on the feckless Annie, beating, to be blunt, the be-Jesus out of her.  I did not like the retributive glint in Reba's eye. “Bride of my autumn, buddy of my bed,” said I, “you have done all that anyone may do for the sake of the Original American. Leave well enough alone. In short, dear wife, mind henceforth your own business.”      48   DILEMMA    How felicitous was early Arizona's choice of the cactus wren as state bird. Strutty, with a raucous song, its single ornithological function seems to be to despoil the landscape with beak and bowel. 	2.0	5	[2, 1, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator discusses President Taft's opposition to capital punishment, Reba's reaction to Annie being beaten by John Hochee, and the choice of the cactus wren as Arizona's state bird. 2: The passage is mostly descriptive and reflective, with little action. The only event that could be considered as time passing is Reba going to the laundry room to help Annie. This might take a few minutes. 3: Let's estimate that Reba's actions take about 5 minutes. 4: 5 minutes. 5: Low confidence, as the passage is mostly descriptive and reflective, with little action to base the time estimate on.

Give us not your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your subway shore, I beg you. O, our bankers and builders and retailers and other assorted promoters will tell you anything to entice you out here, but they serve Mammon, not you. The telephone directory listing of the Credit Bureau of Phoenix includes, for example, a Welcome Newcomer Dept. I lay it on the line. The party's over. The West has had it. California is a shambles. As for Nevada, can you honestly contemplate living in Las Vegas? Beware of Utah unless you adopt the Mormon faith, for Brigham Young's boys have sewed it up. New Mexico is all sheep, artists, nuclear research, oil rigs, and irreclaimable wilderness. Texas of course is unthinkable. Arizona remains, and one of you already arrives here every ten minutes only to find himself unable, after a short stay, to raise sufficient funds to leave.  In sum, buckaroos, the prairie schooners you have watched mogging across your television screens for years have finally reached their destination and disgorged more settlers than we can accommodate, more hopes than we can fulfill, more memories than we can quicken.  It has been said many times in many ways that the Western story is really more a myth about the East than it is about the West, and that only by becoming Westernized can the East be saved. 	2628000.0	10	[1, 2, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator pleads with people from the East and Middle West not to move to the West, claiming that it is overcrowded and that the Western story is more of a myth about the East than the West.  2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage, but the narrator mentions that one person arrives in Arizona every ten minutes. This is the only reference to time, so we can use this as our estimate.  3: 10 minutes have elapsed.  4: 10 minutes.  5: High confidence, as the passage provides a specific time reference.

Or perhaps we have run out of the material. Concluding, I bowed my head a moment in amen, then looked upon Temptation Valley, night-thralled. To the noble vaults I raised my eyes, the splendor of the Western firmament. Toward the horizons I trained them, infernal not with Indian signal fires but with the glow, extinguished now yet vivid in my memory, of baseball parks and supermarkets and golf driving ranges and dog tracks and discount stores and hamburger drive-ins. It was then I saw that single blade of light which stabbed me to the soul. El-Hijo-Puts-Evil-Eye-On-El-Padre! I understood! From my throat was ripped a cry of anguish. Hunted, hounded, I fled the house! 	2.0	3.5	[0, 1, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator describes a horseman who will walk among the people, and people can make of him what they will. The narrator then looks at the night sky and sees a single blade of light that causes them anguish, leading them to flee the house. 2: The passage describes the narrator's thoughts and observations, which could take place within a few minutes. There is no explicit reference to time, but the events described would likely take between 2 to 5 minutes. 3: The midpoint of the range is 3.5 minutes. 4: 3.5 minutes. 5: Low confidence, as the passage is more focused on the narrator's thoughts and observations than on specific events or actions.
80	SwarGT.txt|186|u	 Lashing the lumbering beast of a Bentley, sighting on the searchlight, I drove demented into the desert on a sand track, over cattle guards, through washes, slewing to a stop beside the rig, running, greasewood and cactus tearing at my trousers. High on his pedestal stood the midget, facing the East, supernatural, transcendental, about his sombrero and serape a nimbus of sixty million candle power. How had he known? How had he known?  “Oh God, Titano, oh God!” I shouted. “What have I done? What have I done?”  There was only the generator's roaring malediction. I fought for grace, for forgiveness.  “Titano,” I cried, “if your cross is not knowing where to begin, I understand, I sympathize! Begin anywhere! But speak! Only a word! Speak, damn you!”  It was futile.  After I had caught my breath and started for the car I bade him a last importunate farewell, I made one final, piteous effort.  “Vaya con Dios, Titano!”      55   REQUIESCAT    NEW YORK—VARIETY, show business weekly, reports that the most popular Madison Avenue male model this year is clear-eyed, clean-lunged Eddie Bud Boyd, outdoor type from Arizona. In great demand for beer and cigarette ads, the ex-cowpoke's fee for an hour before the commercial camera has soared to $100. “Dress him Western and pose him right, busting a bronc or treeing a mountain lion,” claims the Irving Freednash Agency, “and you've got America's Baby Picture.” 	5.0	32.5	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator drives to a location in the desert where a midget named Titano is standing on a pedestal, illuminated by a searchlight. The narrator pleads with Titano to speak, but receives no response. The passage ends with a report about a popular male model named Eddie Bud Boyd.  2: The passage describes the narrator driving to the desert location, which could take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour, depending on the distance. The interaction with Titano and the subsequent departure likely take a few minutes. The report about Eddie Bud Boyd does not have a clear time frame, so we will focus on the driving and interaction with Titano. Let's estimate a range of 5 minutes to 1 hour.  3: The midpoint of the range is 32.5 minutes (halfway between 5 minutes and 1 hour).  4: 32.5 minutes.  5: Low confidence, due to the uncertainty about the driving time and the unclear time frame of the report about Eddie Bud Boyd.

MEASURE FOR MEASURE.  SCARCELY had the abbey-bell tolled for five minutes, and already was the church of the Capuchins thronged with auditors. Do not encourage the idea, that the crowd was assembled either from motives of piety or thirst of information. But very few were influenced by those reasons; and in a city where superstition reigns with  such despotic sway as in Madrid, to seek for true devotion would be a fruitless attempt. The audience now assembled in the Capuchin church was collected by various causes, but all of them were foreign to the ostensible motive. The women came to show themselves, the men to see the women: some were attracted by curiosity to hear an orator so celebrated; some came, because they had no better means of employing their time till the play began; some, from being assured that it would be impossible to find places in the church; and one half of Madrid was brought thither by expecting to meet the other half. The only persons truly anxious to hear the preacher, were a few antiquated devotees, and half a dozen rival orators, determined to find fault with and ridicule the discourse. As to the remainder of the audience, the sermon might have been omitted altogether, certainly without their being disappointed, and very probably without their perceiving the omission. 	5.0	20	[0, 1, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The passage describes a church in Madrid filled with people who have come for various reasons, but not primarily for devotion or to hear the sermon. 2: The passage describes the scene as the church fills up, which could take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes. 3: The midpoint of the range is 20 minutes. 4: 20 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
82	LewiMMR.txt|1|u	Whatever was the occasion, it is at least certain, that the Capuchin church had never witnessed a more numerous assembly. Every corner was filled, every seat was occupied. The very statues which ornamented the long aisles were pressed into the service. Boys suspended themselves upon the wings of cherubims; St. Francis and St. Mark bore each a spectator on his shoulders; and St. Agatha found herself under the necessity of carrying double. The consequence was, that, in spite of all their hurry and expedition, our two newcomers, on entering the church, looked round in vain for places. However, the old woman continued to move forwards. In vain were exclamations of displeasure vented against her from all sides: in vain was she addressed with 'I assure you, Segnora, there are no places here,' 'I beg, Segnora, that you will not crowd me so intolerably!' 'Segnora, you cannot pass this way. Bless me! How can people be so troublesome!'  The old woman was obstinate, and on she went. By dint of perseverance and two brawny arms she made a passage through the crowd, and managed to bustle herself into the very body of the church, at no great distance from the pulpit. Her companion had followed her with timidity and in silence, profiting by the exertions of her conductress. 'Holy Virgin!' exclaimed the old woman in a tone of disappointment, while she threw a glance of enquiry round her; 'Holy Virgin! what heat! what a crowd! I wonder what can be the meaning of all this. I believe we must return: there is no such thing as a seat to be had, and nobody seems kind enough to accommodate us with theirs.' 	4.0	3.5	[2, 3, 1, 0]	VALID	1: An old woman and her companion enter a crowded church, looking for a place to sit. They push through the crowd, but find no available seats. 2: The passage describes the two characters entering the church and moving through the crowd. This would likely take between 2 to 5 minutes. 3: The midpoint of the range is 3.5 minutes. 4: 3.5 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
83	LewiMMR.txt|103|u	 THE marquis and Lorenzo proceeded to the hotel in silence. The former employed himself in calling every circumstance to his mind, which related might give Lorenzo's the most favourable idea of his connexion with Agnes. The latter, justly alarmed for the honour of his family, felt embarrassed by the presence of the marquis: the adventure which he had just witnessed forbad his treating him as a friend; and Antonia's interests being entrusted to his mediation, he saw the impolicy of treating him as a foe. He concluded from these  reflections, that profound silence would be the wisest plan, and waited with impatience for Don Raymond's explanation. They arrived at the hotel de las Cisternas. The marquis immediately conducted him to his apartment, and began to express his satisfaction at finding him at Madrid. Lorenzo interrupted him. 'Excuse me, my lord,' said he with a distant air, 'if I reply somewhat coldly to your expressions of regard. A sister's honour is involved in this affair: till that is established, and the purport of your correspondence with Agnes cleared up, I cannot consider you as my friend. I am anxious to hear the meaning of your conduct; and hope that you will not delay the promised explanation.' 'First give me your word, that you will listen with patience and indulgence.' 'I love my sister too well to judge her harshly; and, till this moment, I possessed no friend so dear to me as yourself. I will also confess, that your having it in your power  to oblige me in a business which I have much at heart, makes me very anxious to find you still deserving my esteem.' 	25.0	17.5	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: Lorenzo and the Marquis travel to the hotel in silence, reflecting on the situation involving Agnes and Antonia. Once at the hotel, Lorenzo expresses his concerns about his sister's honor and asks for an explanation from the Marquis.  2: The passage describes the characters traveling to the hotel and having a conversation. The travel time is not specified, but it can be assumed to be a short journey within the city, possibly taking 10 to 20 minutes. The conversation itself seems to last for about 2 to 3 minutes.  3: Taking the midpoint of the travel time range (15 minutes) and adding the conversation time (2.5 minutes), we have a total of 17.5 minutes.  4: 17.5 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence, as the travel time is an estimate.
84	LewiMMR.txt|111|u	Luckily, as I then thought, an opportunity presented itself of passing the night more agreeably than I expected. On mentioning my design of proceeding by myself to Strasbourg, the postillion shook his head in disapprobation. 'It is a long way,' said he; 'you will find it a difficult matter to arrive there without a guide: besides, monsieur seems unaccustomed to the season's severity; and 'tis possible that, unable to sustain the excessive cold ' 'What use is there to present me with all these objections?' said I, impatiently interrupting him: 'I have no other resource; I run still greater risk of perishing with cold by passing the night in the forest.' 'Passing the night in the forest?' he replied. 'Oh, by St. Denis! we are not in quite so bad a plight as that comes to yet. If I am not mistaken, we are scarcely five minutes walk from the cottage of my old friend  Baptiste: he is a wood-cutter, and a very honest fellow. I doubt not but he will shelter you for the night with pleasure. In the mean time, I can take the saddle-horse, ride to Strasbourg, and be back with proper people to mend your carriage by break of day.' 'And, in the name of God,' said I, 'how could you leave me so long in suspense? Why did you not tell me of this cottage sooner? What excessive stupidity!' 'I thought, that perhaps monsieur would not deign to accept ' 	5.0	185	[1, 3, 0, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator's carriage breaks down, and after some discussion, the postillion suggests they seek shelter at a nearby wood-cutter's cottage, which is a five-minute walk away. The postillion plans to ride to Strasbourg and return by daybreak with help to fix the carriage.  2: The passage describes a conversation between the narrator and the postillion, which might take around 5 minutes. Additionally, the postillion mentions that the cottage is a five-minute walk away, and he plans to return by daybreak, which could be several hours later.  3: Let's estimate the conversation and walk to the cottage take 10 minutes, and the postillion's trip to Strasbourg and back takes around 6 hours. The midpoint of this range is 3 hours and 5 minutes, which is 185 minutes.  4: 185 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
85	LewiMMR.txt|147|u	 He rose in spite of his malady, and dressed himself with all speed. I fastened one of the sheets round his arms, and lowered him from the window. He flew to the stable, took Claude's horse, and hastened to Strasbourg. Had he been accosted by the banditti, he was to have declared himself sent upon a message by Baptiste, but fortunately he reached the town without meeting any obstacle. Immediately upon his arrival at Strasbourg, he entreated assistance from the magistrate: his story passed from mouth to mouth, and at length came to the knowledge of my lord the baron. Anxious for the safety of his lady, who he knew would be upon the road that evening, it struck him that she might have fallen into the power of the robbers. He accompanied Theodore, who guided the soldiers towards the cottage, and arrived just in time to save us from falling once more into the hands of our enemies.' Here I interrupted Marguerite to enquire why the sleepy potion had been presented to me. She said, that Baptiste supposed me to have arms about me, and  wished to incapacitate me from making resistance: it was a precaution which he always took, since, as the travellers had no hopes of escaping, despair would have incited them to sell their lives dearly. The baron then desired Marguerite to inform him what were her present plans. I joined him in declaring my readiness to shew my gratitude to her for the preservation of my life. 	6.0	90	[0, 3, 2, 1]	VALID	1: A man, despite being unwell, quickly dresses, is lowered from a window, rides a horse to Strasbourg, and seeks help from the authorities. The baron hears the story and accompanies the man and soldiers back to the cottage to save the people there.  2: The man's actions include dressing, being lowered from a window, riding a horse to Strasbourg, and seeking help. This would likely take at least an hour, possibly up to two hours, considering the time it takes to ride a horse to another location and gather soldiers.  3: The midpoint of the range (1 to 2 hours) is 1.5 hours. Multiplying by 60 minutes an hour, that's 90 minutes.  4: 90 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence, as the exact time it takes to ride a horse to Strasbourg and gather soldiers is uncertain.
86	LewiMMR.txt|193|u	The singularity of my adventure made me determine to conceal it from every one, since I could not expect that a circumstance so strange should gain credit. I was very uneasy about Agnes. I knew not what she would think at not finding me at the rendezvous,  and dreaded her entertaining suspicions of my fidelity. However, I depended upon Theodore's discretion, and trusted that my letter to the baroness would convince her of the rectitude of my intentions. These considerations somewhat lightened my inquietude upon her account; but the impression left upon my mind by my nocturnal visitor, grew stronger with every succeeding moment. The night drew near; I dreaded its arrival; yet I strove to persuade myself that the ghost would appear no more, and at all events I desired that a servant might sit up in my chamber. The fatigue of my body, from not having slept on the former night, co-operating with the strong opiates administered to me in profusion, at length procured me that repose of which I was so much in need. I sunk into a profound and tranquil slumber, and had already slept for some hours, when the neighbouring clock roused me by striking 'one.' Its sound brought with it to my memory all the horrors of the night  before. The same cold shivering seized me. I started up in my bed, and perceived the servant fast asleep in an arm-chair near me. I called him by his name: he made no answer. I shook him forcibly by the arm, and strove in vain to wake him: he was perfectly insensible to my efforts. I now heard the heavy steps ascending the stair-case; the door was thrown open, and again the bleeding nun stood before me. Once more my limbs were chained in second infancy: once more I heard those fatal words repeated, Raymond! Raymond! Thou art mine! 	420.0	240	[0, 2, 1, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator recalls a strange encounter with a ghostly figure and decides to keep it a secret. He worries about Agnes and the rendezvous he missed. He sleeps, wakes up at the sound of a clock striking one, and sees the ghostly figure again.  2: The passage describes the narrator's thoughts and feelings, as well as his sleep. The sleep lasts for 'some hours' before he wakes up at the sound of the clock striking one. We can estimate that the sleep took about 3 to 5 hours.  3: The midpoint of the range is 4 hours. Multiplying by 60 minutes an hour, that's 240 minutes.  4: 240 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
87	LewiMMR.txt|211|u	'The domains of Lindenberg now fell to a distant relation. But terrified by the accounts given him of the bleeding nun [so  was the spectre called by the multitude] the new baron called to his assistance a celebrated exorciser. This holy man succeeded in obliging her to temporary repose: but though she discovered to him her history, he was not permitted to reveal it to others, or cause her skeleton to be removed to hallowed ground. That office was reserved for you; and till your coming her ghost was doomed to wander about the castle, and lament the crime which she had there committed. However, the exorciser obliged her to silence during his life-time. So long as he existed, the haunted chamber was shut up, and the spectre was invisible. At his death, which happened in five years after, she again appeared, but only once on every fifth year, on the same day and at the same hour when she plunged her knife in the heart of her sleeping lover: she then visited the cavern which held her mouldering skeleton, returned to the castle as soon as the clock struck two, and was seen no more till the next five years had elapsed. 'She was doomed to suffer during the space of a century. That period is past. Nothing now remains but to consign to the grave the ashes of Beatrice. I have been the means of releasing you from your visionary tormentor; and amidst all the sorrows which oppress me, to think that I have been of use to you, is some consolation. Youth, farewell! May the ghost of your relation enjoy that rest in the tomb, which the Almighty's vengeance has denied to me for ever!' 	2628000.0	52560000	[3, 1, 0, 2]	VALID	1: The passage describes the history of a spectre called the Bleeding Nun, who haunted a castle for a century. An exorciser temporarily silenced her, but she reappeared every five years after his death. The narrator has helped release the protagonist from the spectre's torment.  2: The passage mentions a century of the spectre's haunting, five years of the exorciser's life, and the recurring appearances every five years. The focus is on the century of haunting, so we will use that as the time described.  3: 100 years have elapsed. At 365 days a year, that's 36,500 days. 24 hours in a day, so 876,000 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 52,560,000 minutes.  4: 52,560,000 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
88	LewiMMR.txt|226|u	She started from the bank on which she was seated. I endeavoured to detain her; but she disengaged herself from me with violence, and took refuge in the convent. I retired, filled with confusion and inquietude. The next morning I failed not, as usual, to appear in the garden; but Agnes was no where to be seen. At night I waited for her at the place where we generally met. I found no better success. Several days and nights passed away in the same manner. At  length I saw my offended mistress cross the walk, on whose borders I was working: she was accompanied by the same young pensioner, on whose arm she seemed, from weakness, obliged to support herself. She looked upon me for a moment, but instantly turned her head away. I waited her return; but she passed on to the convent without paying any attention to me, or the penitent looks with which I implored her forgiveness. As soon as the nuns were retired, the old gardener joined me with a sorrowful air. 'Segnor,' said he, 'it grieves me to say, that I can be no longer of use to you; the lady whom you used to meet has just assured me, that if I admitted you again into the garden, she would discover the whole business to the lady prioress. She bade me tell you also, that your presence was an insult, and that, if you still possess the least respect for her, you will never attempt to see her more. Excuse me then  for informing you, that I can favour your disguise no longer. Should the prioress be acquainted with my conduct, she might not be contented with dismissing me her service: out of revenge, she might accuse me of having profaned the convent, and cause me to be thrown into the prisons of the Inquisition.' 	7200.0	4680	[3, 2, 1, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator tries to meet Agnes in the garden, but she avoids him for several days. When they finally cross paths, she ignores him and sends a message through the gardener that she doesn't want to see him again.  2: The passage describes several days and nights passing away, so at least 3 days and 3 nights. The narrator also waits in the garden during the day and at night, which could take a few hours each time. Let's estimate 3 days and 6 hours.  3: 3 days and 6 hours have elapsed. At 24 hours a day, that's 72 hours plus 6 hours, so 78 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 4680 minutes.  4: 4680 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
89	LewiMMR.txt|237|u	  A feather now of golden hue He smiling from his pinion drew; This to the poet's hand the boy commits; And straight before Anacreaon's eyes The fairest dreams of fancy rise, And round his favoured head wild inspiration flits.   His bosom glows with amorous fire; Eager he grasps the magic lyre; Swift o'er the tuneful chords his fingers move: The feather plucked from Cupid's wing Sweeps the too-long neglected string, While soft Anacreon sings the power and praise of love.   Soon as that name was heard, the woods Shook off their snows; the melting floods Broke their cold chains, and winter fled away. Once more the earth was decked with flowers; Mild zephyrs breathed through blooming bowers; High towered the glorious sun, and poured then blaze of day.    Attracted by the harmonious sound, Sylvans and fauns the cot surround, And curious crowd the minstrel to behold: The wood-nymphs haste the spell to prove; Eager they run; they list, they love, And, while they hear the strain, forget the man is old.   Cupid, to nothing constant long, Perched on the harp attends the song, Or stifles with a kiss the dulcet notes: Now on the poet's breast reposes, Now twines his hoary locks with roses, Or borne on wings of gold in wanton circle floats.   Then thus Anacreon 'I no more At other shrines my vows will pour, Since Cupid deigns my numbers to inspire: From Phoebus or the blue-eyed maid Now shall my verse request no aid, For Love alone shall be the patron of my lyre. 	0	30	[2, 1, 3, 0]	VALID	1: This passage describes a poet, Anacreon, being inspired by a golden feather from Cupid's wing. As he plays his lyre and sings, the seasons change, and various mythological creatures gather to listen and admire his performance.  2: The passage describes a series of events that could take place within a few minutes to an hour. The poet receives the feather, experiences inspiration, plays the lyre, sings, and witnesses the change of seasons and the arrival of mythological creatures.  3: The midpoint of the range would be 30 minutes.  4: 30 minutes.  5: Low confidence, as the passage is more focused on the poetic and symbolic aspects of the scene rather than providing a clear sense of time.
90	LewiMMR.txt|255|u	He was proceeding, but Elvira interrupted him 'Ah! Don Lorenzo, you forget in that pompous title the meanness of my origin.  You forget that I have now passed fourteen years in Spain, disavowed by my husband's family, and existing upon a stipend barely sufficient for the support and education of my daughter. Nay, I have even been neglected by most of my own relations, who out of envy affect to doubt the reality of my marriage. My allowance being discontinued at my father-in-law's death, I was reduced to the very brink of want. In this situation I was found by my sister, who, amongst all her foibles, possesses a warm, generous, and affectionate heart. She aided me with the little fortune which my father left her, persuaded me to visit Madrid, and has supported my child and myself since our quitting Murcia. Then, consider not Antonia as descended from the Condé de las Cisternas; consider her as a poor and unprotected orphan, as the grand-child of the tradesman Torribio Dalfa, as the needy pensioner of that tradesman's daughter. Reflect upon the difference between such a situation and that of the nephew and heir of the potent  duke of Medina. I believe your intentions to be honourable; but as there are no hopes that your uncle will approve of the union, I foresee that the consequences of your attachment must be fatal to my child's repose.' 	2.0	3.5	[1, 2, 0, 3]	VALID	1: Elvira recounts her difficult life, including her 14 years in Spain, her husband's family disavowing her, and her sister's support. She warns Don Lorenzo about the consequences of his attachment to her daughter Antonia.  2: The passage describes Elvira's past experiences, but the conversation between Elvira and Don Lorenzo takes place in the present. The conversation itself might take around 2 to 5 minutes.  3: The midpoint of the range is 3.5 minutes.  4: 3.5 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
91	LewiMMR.txt|315|u	 Ambrosio perceived his mistake, and replaced the book upon the table. Antonia spoke of her mother's health with all the enthusiastic joy of a youthful heart. 'I admire your filial affection,' said the abbot; 'it proves the excellence and sensibility of your character; it promises a treasure to him whom Heaven has destined to possess your affections. The breast so capable of fondness for a parent, what will it feel for a lover? Nay, perhaps, what feels it for one even now? Tell me, my lovely daughter, have you known what it is to love? Answer me with sincerity: forget my habit, and consider me only as a friend.' 'What it is to love?' said she, repeating his question. 'Oh! yes, undoubtedly; I have loved many, many people.' 'That is not what I mean. The love of which I speak can be felt only for one.  Have you never seen the man whom you wished to be your husband?' 'Oh! no, indeed!' This was an untruth, but she was unconscious of its falsehood: she knew not the nature of her sentiments for Lorenzo; and never having seen him since his first visit to Elvira, with every day his image grew less feebly impressed upon her bosom: besides, she thought of a husband with all a virgin's terror, and negatived the friar's demand without a moment's hesitation. 	6.0	3.5	[1, 0, 2, 3]	VALID	1: Antonia and Ambrosio discuss her mother's health, her love for her family, and whether she has ever been in love with a man.  2: The conversation between Antonia and Ambrosio seems to flow naturally and quickly, so it likely takes between 2 to 5 minutes.  3: The midpoint of the range is 3.5 minutes.  4: 3.5 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
92	LewiMMR.txt|384|u	No other sound was heard. The taper, now burnt down to the socket, sometimes flaring upwards, shot a gleam of light through the room, then sinking again seemed upon the point of expiring. Antonia's heart throbbed with agitation; her eyes wandered fearfully over the objects around her, as the trembling flame illuminated them at intervals. She attempted to rise from her seat, but her limbs trembled so violently that she was unable to proceed. She then called Flora, who was in a room at no great distance; but agitation choked  her voice, and her cries died away in hollow murmurs. She passed some minutes in this situation, after which her terrors began to diminish. She strove to recover herself, and acquire strength enough to quit the room. Suddenly she fancied that she heard a low sigh drawn near her. This idea brought back her former weakness. She had already raised herself from her seat, and was on the point of taking the lamp from the table. The imaginary noise stopped her; she drew back her hand, and supported herself upon the back of a chair. She listened anxiously, but nothing more was heard. 'Gracious God!' she said to herself, 'what could be that sound? Was I deceived, or did I really hear it?' 	5.0	7.5	[2, 3, 1, 0]	VALID	1: Antonia is alone in a room, feeling fearful and agitated. She tries to call for Flora but cannot. She attempts to leave the room but hears a sigh, which stops her.  2: The passage describes Antonia's experience in real-time, with her fear and attempts to leave the room. The events described would likely take between 5 to 10 minutes, considering her struggle to move and listen for any sounds.  3: The midpoint of the range is 7.5 minutes.  4: 7.5 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
93	LewiMMR.txt|463|u	He lifted her, still motionless, from the tomb: he seated himself upon a bank of stone, and, supporting her in his arms, watched impatiently for the symptoms of returning animation. Scarcely could he command his passions sufficiently, to restrain himself from enjoying her while yet insensible. His natural lust was increased in ardour by the difficulties which had opposed his satisfying it; as also by his long abstinence from woman, since, from the moment of resigning her claim to his love, Matilda had exiled him from her arms for ever. 'I am no prostitute, Ambrosio,' had she told him, when, in the fullness of his lust, he demanded her favours with more than usual earnestness; 'I am now no more than your friend, and will not be your mistress.  Cease then to solicit my complying with desires which insult me. While your heart was mine, I gloried in your embraces. Those happy times are past; my person is become indifferent to you, and 'tis necessity, not love, which makes you seek my enjoyment. I cannot yield to a request so humiliating to my pride.' Suddenly deprived of pleasures, the use of which had made them an absolute want, the monk felt this restraint severely. Naturally addicted to the gratification of the senses, in the full vigour of manhood and heat of blood, he had suffered his temperament to acquire such ascendency, that his lust was become madness. Of his fondness for Antonia, none but the grosser particles remained; he longed for the possession of her person; and even the gloom of the vault, the surrounding silence, and the resistance which he expected from her, seemed to give a fresh edge to his fierce and unbridled desires. 	20160.0	1	[2, 3, 0, 1]	VALID	1: A man lifts an unconscious woman from a tomb, restrains himself from taking advantage of her, and reflects on his lustful desires and past experiences with another woman.  2: The passage describes the man lifting the woman and sitting down with her, which would take about a minute. The rest of the passage consists of his thoughts and reflections, which could occur within that same minute.  3: 1 minute has elapsed.  4: 1 minute.  5: High confidence.
94	LewiMMR.txt|504|u	As I threw a look of terror round my prison, as I shrunk from the cutting wind which howled through my subterraneous dwelling, the change seemed so striking, so abrupt, that I doubted its reality. That the duke de Medina's niece, that the destined bride of the marquis de las Cisternas, one bred up in affluence, related to the noblest families in Spain, and rich in a multitude of affectionate friends that she should in one moment become a captive, separated from the world for ever, weighed down with chains, and reduced to support life with the coarsest aliments appeared a change so sudden and incredible, that I believed myself the sport of some frightful vision. Its continuance convinced me of  my mistake with but too much certainty. Every morning I looked for some relief from my sufferings: every morning my hopes were disappointed. At length I abandoned all idea of escaping, I resigned myself to my fate, and only expected liberty when she came the companion of death. My mental anguish, and the dreadful scenes in which I had been an actress, advanced the period of my labour. In solitude and misery, abandoned by all, unassisted by art, uncomforted by friendship, with pangs which if witnessed would have touched the hardest heart, was I delivered of my wretched burthen. It came alive into the world; but I knew not how to treat it, or by what means to preserve its existence. I could only bathe it with tears, warm it in my bosom, and offer up prayers for its safety. I was soon deprived of this mournful employment: the want of proper attendance, my ignorance how to nurse it, the bitter cold of the dungeon, and the unwholesome  air which inflated its lungs, terminated my sweet babe's short and painful existence. It expired in a few hours after its birth, and I witnessed its death with agonies which beggar all description. 	141120.0	64800	[2, 3, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The passage describes a woman who has been imprisoned and experiences a sudden change in her life. She gives birth to a child in her cell, but the child dies shortly after due to the harsh conditions. 2: The passage describes the woman's experience in the prison, her labor, and the short life of her child. The time elapsed could be a few weeks to a few months, considering the period of her labor and the child's short life. 3: Taking the midpoint of the range, let's say 1.5 months have elapsed. At 30 days a month, that's 45 days. 24 hours in a day, so 1080 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 64800 minutes. 4: 64800 minutes. 5: Low confidence, due to the lack of specific time references and the need for speculation.
95	LewiMMR.txt|540|u	'Not quit these mountains alive?' he exclaimed: 'Perfidious, what mean you? Have you forgotten our contract?' The fiend answered by a malicious laugh: 'Our contract? Have I not performed my part? What more did I promise than to  save you from your prison? Have I not done so? Are you not safe from the Inquisition safe from all but from me? Fool that you were to confide yourself to a devil! Why did you not stipulate for life, and power, and pleasure? Then all would have been granted: now, your reflections come too late. Miscreant, prepare for death; you have not many hours to live!' On hearing this sentence, dreadful were the feelings of the devoted wretch! He sank upon his knees, and raised his hands towards heaven. The fiend read his intention, and prevented it 'What?' he cried, darting at him a look of fury: 'Dare you still implore the Eternal's mercy? Would you feign penitence, and again act an hypocrite's part? Villain, resign your hopes of pardon. Thus I secure my prey!' As he said this, darting his talons into the monk's shaven crown, he sprang with him from the rock. The caves and mountains rang with Ambrosio's shrieks. The daemon  continued to soar aloft, till reaching a dreadful height, he released the sufferer. Headlong fell the monk through the airy waste; the sharp point of a rock received him; and he rolled from precipice to precipice, till, bruised and mangled, he rested on the river's banks.	2.5	3	[3, 1, 0, 2]	VALID	1: A fiend tells a monk that he will die soon, and then carries him into the air and drops him onto a sharp rock, causing him to roll down to the river's banks. 2: The conversation between the fiend and the monk might take a minute or two, and the action of the fiend carrying the monk into the air and dropping him might take another minute or two. So, the passage likely describes 2 to 4 minutes. 3: The midpoint of the range is 3 minutes. 4: 3 minutes. 5: High confidence.
96	LewiMMR.txt|541|u	Life still existed in his miserable frame: he attempted in vain to raise himself; his broken and dislocated limbs refused to perform their office, nor was he able to quit the spot where he had first fallen. The sun now rose above the horizon; its scorching beams darted full upon the head of the expiring sinner. Myriads of infects were called forth by the warmth; they drank the blood which trickled from Ambrosio's wounds; he had no power to drive them from him, and they fastened upon his sores, darted their stings into his body, covered him with their multitudes, and inflicted on him tortures the most exquisite and insupportable. The eagles of the rock tore his flesh piecemeal, and dug out his eye-balls with their crooked  beaks. A burning thirst tormented him; he heard the river's murmur as it rolled beside him, but strove in vain to drag himself towards the sound. Blind, maimed, helpless, and despairing, venting his rage in blasphemy and curses, execrating his existence, yet dreading the arrival of death destined to yield him up to greater torments, six miserable days did the villain languish. On the seventh a violent storm arose: the winds in fury rent up rocks and forests: the sky was now black with clouds, now sheeted with fire: the rain fell in torrents; it swelled the stream; the waves overflowed their banks; they reached the spot where Ambrosio lay, and, when they abated, carried with them into the river the corse of the despairing monk.  FINIS.       	10080.0	8640	[2, 1, 0, 3]	VALID	1: Ambrosio, injured and unable to move, suffers from insects, eagles, and thirst for six days before a storm comes and washes his body into a river. 2: The passage explicitly states that Ambrosio suffers for six days before the storm arrives. 3: 6 days have elapsed. At 24 hours a day, that's 144 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 8640 minutes. 4: 8640 minutes. 5: High confidence.
97	janeeyre.txt|0|u	CHAPTER I   There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.  I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.  The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy. Me, she had dispensed from joining the group; saying, 'She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy, little children.'  'What does Bessie say I have done?' I asked. 	1440.0	140	[2, 3, 1, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator describes a cold, rainy day when they cannot go for a walk. They mention an earlier walk in the morning and dinner, and then describe a scene in the drawing-room where the narrator is excluded from the group. 2: The passage mentions a walk in the morning, dinner, and the current scene in the drawing-room. The walk in the morning could have taken an hour, dinner could have taken an hour, and the drawing-room scene could be around 10-20 minutes. So, a range of 2 hours and 10 minutes to 2 hours and 30 minutes. 3: The midpoint of the range is 2 hours and 20 minutes. Multiplying by 60 minutes an hour, that's 140 minutes. 4: 140 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
98	janeeyre.txt|1|u	 'Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent.'  A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there. It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the window- seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement.  Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast.  I returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite as a blank. They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of 'the solitary rocks and promontories' by them only inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape--  'Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls, Boils round the naked, melancholy isles Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge Pours in among the stormy Hebrides.' 	10.0	7.5	[0, 2, 3, 1]	VALID	1: A child named Jane is told to be silent and find a place to sit. She goes to the breakfast room, finds a book, and sits in a window seat, observing the weather outside while flipping through the book.  2: The passage describes Jane's actions and thoughts, which likely take around 5 to 10 minutes. She moves to the breakfast room, selects a book, sits down, observes the weather, and reads parts of the book.  3: The midpoint of the range (5 to 10 minutes) is 7.5 minutes.  4: 7.5 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.

They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk, and furs. The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a false front of French curls.  These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the room. It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned the laundress, and lectured the superintendent. They now proceeded to address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and enchanted my attention. 	5.0	7.5	[2, 3, 0, 1]	VALID	1: A man named Mr. Brocklehurst lectures on the importance of modesty in dress, but is interrupted by the arrival of three well-dressed ladies. They converse with Miss Temple and Miss Smith, while the narrator's attention is drawn elsewhere. 2: The passage describes a lecture, an interruption, and a conversation. The lecture might have taken a few minutes, and the conversation could have taken a similar amount of time. Let's estimate between 5 and 10 minutes. 3: The midpoint of the range is 7.5 minutes. 4: 7.5 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence, as the exact duration of the lecture and conversation is not specified.
100	janeeyre.txt|184|u	When I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant; and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye, traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.  I did not like re-entering Thornfield. To pass its threshold was to return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only, was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,--to slip again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I was becoming incapable of appreciating. What good it would have done me at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for the calm amidst which I now repined! Yes, just as much good as it would do a man tired of sitting still in a 'too easy chair' to take a long walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances, as it would be under his. 	3.0	23	[2, 1, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator stops at a stile, listens and looks around, then hurries on to Thornfield, where they feel a sense of stagnation and reflect on their desire for a more exciting life. 2: The time spent stopping, looking, and listening at the stile is likely a minute or two. The walk to Thornfield is mentioned to be a mile distant, which would take approximately 15-20 minutes. The narrator's reflection on their life could take a few minutes as well. 3: Let's estimate 2 minutes at the stile, 18 minutes for the walk, and 3 minutes for reflection, totaling 23 minutes. 4: 23 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
101	janeeyre.txt|200|u	 'Were you happy when you painted these pictures?' asked Mr. Rochester presently.  'I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy. To paint them, in short, was to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known.'  'That is not saying much. Your pleasures, by your own account, have been few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's dreamland while you blent and arranged these strange tints. Did you sit at them long each day?'  'I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply.'  'And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?'  'Far from it. I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite powerless to realise.'  'Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more, probably. You had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar. As to the thoughts, they are elfish. These eyes in the Evening Star you must have seen in a dream. How could you make them look so clear, and yet not at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays. And what meaning is that in their solemn depth? And who taught you to paint wind? 	2.0	25200	[0, 1, 2, 3]	VALID	1: Mr. Rochester and the protagonist discuss her paintings, her happiness while creating them, and the time she spent on them during a vacation.  2: The protagonist mentions that she painted during a vacation and spent from morning till noon and from noon till night working on them. The length of midsummer days is mentioned, which implies that the vacation took place during the summer. We can estimate that the vacation lasted at least a week, but not more than a month.  3: Taking the midpoint of the range (1 week to 4 weeks), we have 2.5 weeks. At seven days a week, that's 17.5 days. 24 hours in a day, so 420 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 25,200 minutes.  4: 25,200 minutes.  5: Low confidence, as the exact duration of the vacation is not specified.
102	janeeyre.txt|257|u	 Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit. Thanks to it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which, had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to maintain, even externally.     CHAPTER XVII   A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and still he did not come. Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent, and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected. When I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill and failing at the heart. I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles, I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got over the temporary blunder--how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr. 	14400.0	14400	[3, 0, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator reflects on their ability to maintain calm in the face of Mr. Rochester's absence. A week passes, then ten days, and Mr. Rochester still has not returned. The narrator experiences disappointment but manages to regain composure.  2: The passage explicitly mentions the passage of ten days.  3: 10 days have elapsed. At 24 hours in a day, that's 240 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 14,400 minutes.  4: 14400 minutes.  5: High confidence.
103	janeeyre.txt|355|u	And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with man.  When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either to one's self or one's kin. The saying might have worn out of my memory, had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix it there. The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her little sister.  Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water. It was a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it nestled close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber. 	10080.0	10080	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator recalls a saying about dreaming of children being a sign of trouble and remembers an incident from her childhood. She then describes her recent dreams of infants over the past week.  2: The passage mentions the narrator's childhood memory, which happened when she was six years old, and the past week of dreams. The time elapsed in the passage is the week of dreams.  3: 1 week has elapsed. At seven days a week that's 7 days. 24 hours in a day, so 168 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 10080 minutes.  4: 10080 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence, as the childhood memory is not counted as time passing in the scene.
104	janeeyre.txt|358|u	 I was silent: the things were frightful. Robert Leaven resumed--  'Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of poverty were quite breaking her down. The information about Mr. John's death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke. She was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making signs to my wife and mumbling. It was only yesterday morning, however, that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she made out the words, 'Bring Jane--fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to her.' Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and advised them to send for you. The young ladies put it off at first; but their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times, that at last they consented. I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow morning.'  'Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go.'  'I think so too, Miss. Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse: but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?' 	2.0	3.5	[2, 1, 0, 3]	VALID	1: The passage describes a conversation between Jane Eyre and Robert Leaven about the deteriorating health of Jane's former guardian, Mrs. Reed. Robert explains that Mrs. Reed has been calling for Jane and that he would like to take Jane back with him the next morning.  2: The conversation itself likely takes a few minutes. There is a reference to events that occurred over the past few days, but these are not described in detail and should not be counted as time passing in the scene. The conversation could take between 2 to 5 minutes.  3: The midpoint of the range is 3.5 minutes.  4: 3.5 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
105	janeeyre.txt|561|u	 On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry. My black silk frock hung against the wall. The traces of the bog were removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite decent. My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered presentable. There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and brush to smooth my hair. After a weary process, and resting every five minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself. My clothes hung loose on me; for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once more, clean and respectable looking--no speck of the dirt, no trace of the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left--I crept down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.  It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous fire. Hannah was baking. Prejudices, it is well known, are most difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones. Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly she had begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in tidy and well-dressed, she even smiled. 	25.0	15	[1, 2, 0, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator wakes up, finds their clothes cleaned and dried, and proceeds to dress themselves. They then make their way down to the kitchen where Hannah is baking bread.  2: The passage describes the narrator waking up, dressing, and walking downstairs. Dressing and walking downstairs could take around 10 to 20 minutes, considering the narrator mentions resting every five minutes.  3: The midpoint of the range is 15 minutes.  4: 15 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
106	janeeyre.txt|589|u	 He left the room. In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.  Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached for leaving their brother and their home. They both tried to appear as usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not be entirely conquered or concealed. Diana intimated that this would be a different parting from any they had ever yet known. It would probably, as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it might be a parting for life.  'He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves,' she said: 'natural affection and feelings more potent still. St. John looks quiet, Jane; but he hides a fever in his vitals. You would think him gentle, yet in some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it. It is right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!' And the tears gushed to her fine eyes. Mary bent her head low over her work.  'We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,' she murmured. 	10080.0	1440	[3, 1, 2, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator learns more about a man in an hour, and two sisters, Diana and Mary, become increasingly sad as the day of their brother's departure approaches, which might be a parting for years or even life.  2: The passage mentions a 'brief hour' in which the narrator learns about the man, and the sisters' sadness increases as the day of departure approaches. We can estimate that the events described take place over a day.  3: 1 day has elapsed. Multiplying by 24 hours in a day and 60 minutes in an hour, that's 1440 minutes.  4: 1440 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
107	janeeyre.txt|595|u	 Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile from the village. The birds were singing their last strains--  'The air was mild, the dew was balm.'  While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself ere long weeping--and why? For the doom which had reft me from adhesion to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and fatal fury--consequences of my departure--which might now, perhaps, be dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate restoration thither. At this thought, I turned my face aside from the lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton--I say _lonely_, for in that bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived. I hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone frame of my door; but soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the meadow beyond it made me look up. A dog--old Carlo, Mr. Rivers' pointer, as I saw in a moment--was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John himself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave almost to displeasure, fixed on me. I asked him to come in. 	8.0	10	[2, 1, 0, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator reflects on their feelings and looks at the sunset, then notices a dog and St. John at the gate, and invites St. John in. 2: The passage describes the narrator's thoughts and observations, which could take anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes. 3: The midpoint of the range is 10 minutes. 4: 10 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
108	janeeyre.txt|603|u	Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she for a woman. His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty. But he curbed it, I think, as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed. He responded neither by word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.  'Papa says you never come to see us now,' continued Miss Oliver, looking up. 'You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall. He is alone this evening, and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?'  'It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver,' answered St. John.  'Not a seasonable hour! But I declare it is. It is just the hour when papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no business to occupy him. Now, Mr. Rivers, _do_ come. Why are you so very shy, and so very sombre?' She filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of her own.  'I forgot!' she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if shocked at herself. 'I am so giddy and thoughtless! _Do_ excuse me. It had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for joining in my chatter. Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is shut up, and you are so lonely. I am sure I pity you. Do come and see papa.' 	2.0	3	[2, 1, 3, 0]	VALID	1: A man and a woman have a conversation in which she invites him to visit her father, but he initially declines. She insists, and he remains silent. 2: The conversation between the two characters would likely take between 2 to 4 minutes, as there are several exchanges and pauses for thought. 3: The midpoint of the range is 3 minutes. 4: 3 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
109	janeeyre.txt|699|u	 It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time. I filled the interval in walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had given my plans their present bent. I recalled that inward sensation I had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable strangeness. I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned whence it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_--not in the external world. I asked was it a mere nervous impression--a delusion? I could not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration. The wondrous shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations of Paul and Silas's prison; it had opened the doors of the soul's cell and loosed its bands--it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous body.  'Ere many days,' I said, as I terminated my musings, 'I will know something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me. Letters have proved of no avail--personal inquiry shall replace them.'  At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey, and should be absent at least four days.  'Alone, Jane?' they asked. 	120.0	120	[3, 2, 1, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator wakes up two hours before breakfast, ponders a mysterious voice they heard, and decides to go on a journey to learn more about the person behind the voice. They announce their plans at breakfast. 2: The passage begins two hours before breakfast and ends at breakfast. The time spent pondering and walking around the room is not explicitly stated, but it can be assumed to be a portion of the two hours before breakfast. So, the passage describes approximately two hours. 3: 2 hours have elapsed. Multiplying by 60 minutes an hour, that's 120 minutes. 4: 120 minutes. 5: High confidence.
110	janeeyre.txt|707|u	 'Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?' I asked, knowing, of course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the direct question as to where he really was.  'No, ma'am--oh, no! No one is living there. I suppose you are a stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last autumn,--Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about harvest-time. A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved. The fire broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from Millcote, the building was one mass of flame. It was a terrible spectacle: I witnessed it myself.'  'At dead of night!' I muttered. Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality at Thornfield. 'Was it known how it originated?' I demanded.  'They guessed, ma'am: they guessed. Indeed, I should say it was ascertained beyond a doubt. You are not perhaps aware,' he continued, edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, 'that there was a lady--a--a lunatic, kept in the house?'  'I have heard something of it.'  'She was kept in very close confinement, ma'am: people even for some years was not absolutely certain of her existence. No one saw her: they only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what she was it was difficult to conjecture. They said Mr. Edward had brought her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress. But a queer thing happened a year since--a very queer thing.' 	2.0	453600	[1, 3, 0, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator asks about Mr. Rochester and Thornfield Hall, and learns that the hall burned down last autumn. The speaker also mentions a lady who was a lunatic and kept in confinement at the hall. 2: The passage refers to an event that happened last autumn, and another event that happened a year ago. The conversation itself might take a few minutes. 3: The midpoint between last autumn and a year ago is approximately 10.5 months. Converting 10.5 months to minutes: 10.5 months x 30 days/month x 24 hours/day x 60 minutes/hour = 453,600 minutes. 4: 453,600 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
111	janeeyre.txt|749|u	He and I went up to London. He had the advice of an eminent oculist; andhe eventually recovered the sight of that one eye. He cannot now see very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his way without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him--the earth no longer a void. When his first-born was put into his arms, he could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they once were--large, brilliant, and black. On that occasion, he again, with a full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy. My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most love are happy likewise. Diana and Mary Rivers are both married: alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see them. Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good man. Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother's, and, from his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection. Both Captain Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by them. As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India. He entered on the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still. A more resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.	3500000.0	3938400	[1, 0, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator describes the recovery of a man's partial eyesight, the happiness of their family and friends, and the life of St. John Rivers in India. 2: The passage describes events that span several years, including the man's recovery, the birth of his first child, the marriages of Diana and Mary Rivers, and St. John Rivers' life in India. It is difficult to determine the exact number of years, but we can estimate a range of 5 to 10 years. 3: The midpoint of the range is 7.5 years. At 365 days a year, that's 2737.5 days. 24 hours in a day, so 65640 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 3938400 minutes. 4: 3938400 minutes. 5: Low confidence, due to the wide range of possible time spans.
112	janeeyre.txt|750|u	Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it. He may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from the onslaught of Apollyon. His is the exaction of the apostle, who speaks but for Christ, when he says--'Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.' His is the ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth--who stand without fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.  St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now. Himself has hitherto sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun hastens to its setting. The last letter I received from him drew from my eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated his sure reward, his incorruptible crown. I know that a stranger's hand will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been called at length into the joy of his Lord. And why weep for this? No fear of death will darken St. John's last hour: his mind will be unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith steadfast. His own words are a pledge of this--  'My Master,' he says, 'has forewarned me. Daily He announces more distinctly,--'Surely I come quickly!' and hourly I more eagerly respond,--'Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!'' 	525600.0	262800	[1, 3, 2, 0]	VALID	1: The passage describes the character St. John, his dedication to his work, and his anticipation of his own death.  2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the passage implies that St. John has been working for a long time and that his death is near. We can guess that the time described in the passage might be a few months to a year.  3: Taking the midpoint of the range (6 months), we can convert it to minutes. 6 months is approximately 182.5 days (assuming 30.5 days per month). Multiplying by 24 hours in a day, we get 4380 hours. Multiplying by 60 minutes in an hour, we get 262800 minutes.  4: 262800 minutes.  5: Low confidence, due to the speculative nature of the time estimate.

YOUR resolution to accompany Mrs. Reeves to London, has greatly alarmed your three Lovers. And two of them, at least, will let you know that it has. Such a lovely girl as my Harriet, must expect to be more accountable for her steps than one less excellent and less attractive. Mr. Greville, in his usual resolute way, threatens to follow you to London; and there, he says, he will watch the motions of every man who approaches you; and, if he find reason for it, will early let such man know his pretensions, and the danger he may run into, if he pretend to be his competitor. But let me not do him injustice; though he talks of a rival thus harshly, he speaks of you more highly than man ever spoke of woman. Angel and Goddess are phrases you have been used to from him; and tho' spoken in  his humorous way, yet I am sure he most sincerely admires you. Mr. Fenwick, in a less determined manner, declares, that he will follow you to town, if you stay there above one fortnight. The gentle Orme sighs his apprehensions, and wishes you would change your purpose. Tho' hopeless, he says, it is some pleasure to him, that he can think himself in the same county with you; and much more, that he can tread in your footsteps to and from church every Sunday, and behold you there. He wonders how your grandmamma, your aunt, your uncle, can spare you. Your cousin Reeves's surely, he says, are very happy in their influences over us all. 	20160.0	720	[0, 3, 1, 2]	VALID	1: In this epistolary narrative, the letter-writer informs her friend Harriet that Harriet's decision to go to London has alarmed her three suitors, who express their intentions to follow her or worry about her departure. 2: The passage does not explicitly mention the time it takes for the events to occur.

If you hold your resolution, and my cousin Reeves's their time of setting out, pray let me know, and I will attend you at my uncle Selby's, to wish you a good journey, much pleasure in town, and a return with a safe and sound heart. My sister, who, poor dear girl, continues extremely weak and low, will spare me for a purpose so indispensable. I will not have you come to us. I know it would grieve you to see her in the way she is in. You too much take to heart the infirmities of your friends which you cannot cure; and as your grandmamma lives upon your smiles, and you rejoice all your friends by your chearfulness, it would be cruel to make you sad. MR. GREVILLE has just left us. He dropt in upon us as we were going to dinner. My grandmother Selby you know is always pleased with his rattling. She prevailed on him to alight, and sit down with us. All his talk was of you. He repeated his  former threatenings (as I called them to him) on your going to town.

And by whom? Have I written any thing so very blazing! Surely I have not. But you should not say you will all forgive me, if this be my sad situation. You should not say, How much you are yourselves, all of you, in love with this excellent man; and talk of Mr. Dawson, and of what he says of him: But you should have told me, that if I suffer my gratitude to grow into Love, you will never forgive me; then should I have had a call of duty to check or controul a passion, that you were afraid could not be gratified. Well, and there is no way left me, it seems, but to fly for it! To hurry away to Northamptonshire, and either to begin a new treaty with Lord D. or to give hope to an old Lover. Poor Harriet Byron! And is it indeed so bad with thee? And does thy aunt Selby think it is!  But is there no hope, that the man will take pity of thee?

The attention he pays to her affairs takes up a good deal of his time. He is his own steward; and then he has a variety of other engagements, of which we ask him not one word; yet long to know something about them. But this we are sure of, that, if he thinks any-thing will give us pleasure, we shall hear of it: if the contrary, he is as secret as the night.

He is one of the handsomest men in England, they tell me. Miss Gr. Sisters are not judges. They may be partial. His benignity of heart makes his face shine. Had I a lover but half as handsome as I think my brother, I should make no objection to him on the account of person. Lady L. But he is the genteelest of men! What think you, sister Harriet? Harriet. Sisters are not judges. They may be partial. What meant Lady L. to apply to me? But I had been some time silent.

117	RichSHS.txt|643|u	Dear Sir! said Caroline, flinging herself on her knees by me, forgive my sister! Dear, good Sir! whatever becomes of me, forgive your Charlotte! Sir Tho. You are fearless of your destiny, Caroline. You will throw yourself into the arms of Lord L. I doubt not. I will send for your brother. But you shall both leave this house. I will shut it up the moment you are gone. It shall never again be open'd while I live. When my ashes are mingled with those of your mother, then may you keep open house in it, and trample under foot the ashes of both. I sobbed out, Dear Sir, forgive me! I meant not to reflect upon my father, when I wish'd for my mother. I wish'd for her for your sake, Sir, as well as for ours. She would have mediated. She would have soften'd Sir Tho. My hard heart I know what you mean, Charlotte! And flung from us a few paces, walking about in wrath, leaving us kneeling at his vacant chair. He then, ringing the bell, the door in his hand, ordered in the housekeeper. She enter'd. A very good woman she was. She trembled for her kneeling Ladies.  Sir Th. Beckford, do you assist these girls in getting up every thing that belongs to them. Give me an inventory of what they take. Their father's authority is grievous to them. They want to shake it off.

Why that's a quaint word, tho' a female one. I believe, if I were to marry the honest man, I could be civil to him, if he would be very complaisant, very observant, and all that Pray, brother, don't, however, be angry with me. Sir Ch. I will not, Charlotte, smiling. It is constitution, you say. But if y u cannot be more than civil; and if he is to be very observant; you'll make it your agreement with him, before you meet him at the altar, that he shall subscribe to the woman's part of the vow; and that you shall answer to the man's. Miss Gr. A good thought, I believe! I'll consider of it. If I find, in courtship, the man will bear it, I may make the proposal. Yet I don't know, but it will be as well to suppose the vow changed, without conditioning for it, as other good women do; and act accordingly. One would not begin with a singularity, for fear of putting the parson out. I heard an excellent Lady once advise a good wise, who, however, very little wanted it, to give the man a hearing, and never do any thing that he would wish to be done, except she chose to do it. If the man loves quiet, he'll be glad to compound. 	2.0	3.5	[3, 1, 2, 0]	VALID	1: In this passage, Miss Gr. and Sir Ch. discuss the possibility of her marrying Lord G. and whether she loves or esteems him.

119	RichSHS.txt|1084|u	Miss Gr. Well, and you like me, just now? That's the beauty of it; to offend and make up, at pleasure. Old Terence was a shrewd man: The falling out of Lovers, says he (as Lord L. once quoted him), is the renewal of Love. Are we not now better friends, than if we had never differed? And do you think that I will not, if I marry, exercise my husband's patience now-and-then for this very purpose? Let me alone, Harriet: Now a quarrel; now a reconciliation; I warrant I shall be happier than any of the yawning see-saws in the kingdom. Everlasting summers would be a grievance. Harriet. You may be right, if you are exceeding discreet in your perversenesses, Charlotte; and yet if  you are, you will not lay out for a quarrel, I fansy. The world, or you will have better luck than your brother seems to have had, will find you opportunities enow, for exercising the tempers of both, without your needing to study for occasions. Miss Gr. Study for them, Harriet! I sha'n't study for them, neither: They will come of course. Harriet. I was about to ask a question But 'tis better let alone. Miss Gr. I will have it. What was your question? Don't you see what a good-natured fool I am? You may say any-thing to me: I won't be angry. Harriet.

120	RichSHS.txt|1108|u	I walked by the side of it, and in this manner moved towards Cremona, in order to shorten the way of the expected surgeon. My servant soon returned with one. Jeronymo had sainted away. The surgeon dressed him, and proceeded with him to Cremona. Then it was, that, opening his eyes, he beheld, and knew me; and being told, by the sugeon, that he owed his preservation to me, O Grandison! said he, that I had followed your advice! that I had kept my promise with you! How did I insult you! Can my deliverer forgive me? You shall be the director of my future life, if it please God to restore me. His wounds proved not mortal; but he never will be the man he was: Partly from his having been unskilfully treated by this his first surgeon; and partly from his own impatience, and the difficulty of curing the wound in his hip-joint. Excuse this particularity, madam. The subject requires it; and Signor Jeronymo now deserves it, and all your pity. I attended him at Cremona, till he was fit to remove. He was visited there by his whole family from Bologna. There never was a family more affectionate to one another: The suffering of one, is the suffering of every one. The Barone was exceedingly beloved by his father, mother, sister, for the sweetness of his manners, his affectionate heart, and a wit so delightfully gay and lively, that his company was sought by every-body. 	20160.0	5040	[2, 3, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator describes walking to Cremona to find a surgeon for Jeronymo, who had fainted.

121	RichSHS.txt|1380|u	The daughters are remarkable for their piety, patience, good oeconomy, and prudence. They are the most dutiful of children, and most affectionate of sisters. They were for three years the support of their father's spirits, and have always been the consolation of their mother. They lost their father about four years ago: And it is even edifying to observe▪ how elegantly they support the family reputation in their fine old mansion house by the prudent management of their little income; for the matter leaves every houshold care to them; and they make it a rule to conclude the year with discharging every demand that  can be made upon them, and to commence the new year absolutely clear of the world, and with some cash in hand; yet were brought up in affluence, and to the expectation of handsome fortunes; for, besides that they could have no thought of losing their cause, they had very great and reasonable prospects from Mr Calvert, an uncle by their mother's side; who was rich in money, and had besides an estate in land of 1500 l. a year.	2102400.0	2102400	[3, 0, 1, 2]	VALID	1: The passage describes the daughters' virtues and how they have managed their family's reputation and finances since their father's death four years ago. 2: The passage mentions the father's death four years ago and the daughters' management of the family's affairs for three years.

122	RichSHS.txt|1547|u	Upon some occasion, Lady G. reflected upon a Lady for prudery; and was going on, when Sir Charles, interrupting her, said, Take care, Lady G. You, Ladies, take care; for I am afraid that MODESTY, under this name, will become ignominious, and be banished the hearts, at least the behaviour and conversation, of all those whose fortunes or inclinations carry them often to places of public resort. Talk of places of public resort! said Lord L.; It is vexatious to observe at such, how men of real merit are neglected by the fine Ladies of the age, while every distinction is shewn to fops and foplings. But, who, my Lord, said Sir Charles, are those women? Are they not generally of a class with those men? Flippant women love empty men, because they cannot reproach them with a superiority of understanding, but keep their solly in countenance. They are afraid of a wise man: But I would by no means have such a one turn sool to please them: For they will despise the wise man's folly more than the silly man's, and with reason; because being uncharacteristic, it must sit more aukwardly upon him than the others can do. Yet wisdom itself, and the truest wisdom, goodness, said Mrs. Reeves, is sometimes thought to sit ungracefully, when it is uncharacteristic, not to the man, but to the times. She then named a person who was branded as an hypocrite, for performing all his duties publicly. 	5.0	6	[1, 3, 2, 0]	VALID	1: The passage involves a conversation among several people discussing prudery, modesty, the behavior of men and women in public places, and the perception of wisdom and hypocrisy. 2: The passage describes a conversation, which might take anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes, depending on the pace and depth of the discussion. 3: The midpoint of the range is 6 minutes. 4: 6 minutes. 5: Low confidence, as the conversation's length is not explicitly stated and could vary depending on the pace of the discussion.

Father Marescotti had given me an advantageous character of the General's Lady, whom I had not yet seen. The Bishop had told me, that she was such another excellent woman as his mother, and, like her, had the Italian reserve softened by a polite French education, The Marquis, the Count, Father Marescotti, and this real fine Lady, were in the drawingroom. The General presented me to her. I do not, madam, bid you admire the Chevalier Grandison: But I forgive you if you do; because you will not be able to do otherwise. My Lord, said she, you told me an hour ago, that I must: And now, that I see the Chevalier, you will have no cause to reproach me with disobedience. I bowed on her hand. Father Marescotti, madam, said I, bid me expect from the Lady of the young Marchese della Porretta every-thing that was condescending and good. Your compassionate Love for an unhappy new sister, who deserves every-one's Love, exalts your character. Father Marescotti came in. We took our places. It was designed, I found, to try to revive the young Lady's attention, by introducing her in full assembly, I one of it.

I have it ] And when tea was over, he, without a blush, without looking down, as a girl would do in this situation [But why so, Harriet? Is a woman, on these occasions, to act a part as if she supposed herself to be the greatest gainer by  matrimony; and therefore was ashamed of consenting to accept of an honourable offer? As if, in other words, she was to be the self-denying receiver rather than conferrer of an obligation? Lord, how we rambling-headed creatures break in upon ourselves!] with a good grace he told us of his intention to marry; of his apparition to Mrs. Shirley; of his sudden vanishing; and all that And then he produced Mrs. Shirley's Letter, but just received. And do you think we were not overjoyed? Indeed we were. We congratulated him: We congratulated each other: Lord L. looked as he did when Caroline gave him his happy day: Lord G. could not keep his seat: He was tipsy, poor man, with his joy: Aunt Nell prank'd herself, stroked her ribbands of pink and yellow, and chuckled and mumped for joy, that her nephew at last would not go out of Old England for a wife.

I want courage, my Harriet, to acquaint her with it. I have more than once essayed to do it. Dear creature! she looks with so much innocence, and so much reliance upon me; and is, at times, so apprehensive! I know not how to break it to her. She depends upon my mediation. She urges me to begin a treaty of reconciliation with them. I defer writing, I tell her, till I have seen Mrs. Beaumont.  Little does she think they are upon their journey, and that I know not where to direct to them. She longs for Mrs. Beaumont's arrival; and hopes, she says, she will bring with her the poor Camilla, that she may have an opportunity to obtain her excuse for the harsh treatment she gave her: And yet Camilla, said she, was a teazing woman. Were you ever sensible, my Harriet, of the tender pain that an open heart (yours is an open and an enlarged one) feels; longing, yet, for its friend's sake, afraid, to reveal unwelcome tidings, which, however, it imports the concerned to know? How loth to disturb the tranquillity which is built upon ignorance of the event! Yet that every tranquillity (contemplated upon) adding to the pain of the compassionating friend; who reflects, that when the unhappy news shall be revealed, Time, and Christian philosophy, only, will ever restore it to the heart of the sufferer! 	10080.0	1440	[2, 1, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator is struggling to reveal to a woman that her family is coming to England, and she is unaware of it.
