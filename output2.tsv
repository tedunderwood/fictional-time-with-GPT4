1	RadcASR.txt|0|u	  A SICILIAN ROMANCE. ON the northern shore of Sicily are still to be seen the magnificent remains of a castle, which formerly belonged to the noble house of Mazzini. It stands in the centre of a small bay, and upon a gentle acclivity, which, on one side, slopes towards the sea, and on the other rises into an eminence crowned by dark woods. The situation is admirably beautiful and picturesque, and the ruins have an air of ancient grandeur, which, contrasted with the present solitude of the scene, impresses the traveller with awe and curiosity. During my travels abroad I visited this spot. As I walked over the loose fragments  of stone, which lay scattered through the immense area of the fabrick, and surveyed the sublimity and grandeur of the ruins, I recurred, by a natural association of ideas, to the times when these walls stood proudly in their original splendour, when the halls were the scenes of hospitality and festive magnificence, and when they resounded with the voices of those whom death had long since swept from the earth. 'Thus, said I,' shall the present generation he who now sinks in misery and he who now swims in pleasure, alike pass away and be forgotten.' My heart swelled with the reflection; and, as I turned from the scene with a sigh, I fixed my eyes upon a friar, whose venerable figure, gently bending towards the earth, formed no uninteresting object in the picture. He observed my emotion; and, as my eye met his, shook his head and pointed to the ruin. 'These walls,' 	52560000.0	60	[0, 1, 2, 3]	VALID	1: The passage describes the ruins of a castle in Sicily, and the narrator's reflections on the transience of human life.  2: The events described in the passage are mostly the narrator's thoughts and observations, which would take only a few minutes. However, the narrator also mentions visiting the castle and walking around the ruins, which would take at least an hour.  3: Let's say the narrator spent an hour at the castle.  4: 60 minutes.  5: High confidence.

Madame de Menon, disturbed at this phaenomenon, hastened into the castle, with a view of enquiring into the cause of it, when she was met in the north hall by Vincent. She related to him what she had seen, and ordered an immediate search to be made for the keys of those apartments. She apprehended  that some person had penetrated that part of the edifice with an intention of plunder; and, disdaining a paltry fear where her duty was concerned, she summoned the servants of the castle, with an intention of accompanying them thither. Vincent smiled at her apprehensions, and imputed what she had seen to an illusion, which the solemnity of the hour had impressed upon her fancy. Madame, however, persevered in her purpose; and, after a long and repeated search, a massey key covered with rust was produced. She then proceeded to the southern side of the edifice, accompanied by Vincent, and followed by the servants, who were agitated with impatient wonder. The key was applied to an iron gate, which opened into a court that separated this division from the other parts of the castle. They entered this court, which was overgrown with grass and weeds, and ascended some steps that led to a large door,  which they vainly endeavoured to open. 	120.0	45	[1, 0, 3, 2]	VALID	1: Madame de Menon and Vincent observe a strange phenomenon, and Madame de Menon orders a search of the castle. They find a rusty key and use it to try to open a door, but are unsuccessful. 2: The events described in the passage, including observation, conversation, and searching, would have taken at least 30 minutes, but probably no more than an hour. 3: 45 minutes have elapsed.  4: 45 minutes. 5: High confidence.

Julia, almost fainting, gave her hand to Ferdinand; and Hippolitus, after some short expression of his thankfulness, followed. They passed the door of Madame's chamber;  and treading the gallery with slow and silent steps, descended to the hall. This they crossed towards a door, after opening which they were to find their way through various passages to a remote part of the castle, where a private door opened upon the walls. Ferdinand carried the several keys. They fastened the hall door after them, and proceeded through a narrow passage terminating in a stair-case. They descended, and had hardly reached the bottom, when they heard a loud noise at the door above, and presently the voices of several people. Julia scarcely felt the ground she trod on, and Ferdinand slew to unlock a door that obstructed their way. He applied the different keys, and at length found the proper one, but the lock was rusted, and refused to yield. Their distress now was not to be conceived. 	10.0	10	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: Ferdinand, Julia, and Hippolitus hurry through a castle, trying to escape from someone. They pass Madame's chamber, cross a hall, go through a narrow passage, and descend a staircase. They hear a loud noise and voices from above. Ferdinand tries to unlock a door, but the lock is rusted and won't open. 2: The events described involve a lot of movement and action, but there is no explicit reference to time. Let's say that the events would take at least 10 minutes to happen, given the number of locations they pass through and the difficulty of unlocking the door.  3: 10 minutes have elapsed. 4: 10 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

Henceforth be cautions how ye credit the phantasms of idleness, for ye may not always meet with a master who will condescend to undeceive ye.' They acknowledged the goodness of the marquis, and professing themselves perfectly conscious of the error of their former suspicions, desired they might search no farther. 'I chuse to leave nothing to your imagination,' replied  the marquis, lest hereafter it should betray you into a similar error. Follow me, therefore; you shall see the whole of these buildings.' Saying this he led them to the south tower. They remembered, that from a door of this tower, the figure which caused their alarm had issued; and notwithstanding the late assertion of their suspicions being removed, fear still operated powerfully upon their minds, and they would willingly have been excused from farther research. 'Would any of you chuse to explore this tower?' said the marquis, pointing to the broken stair-case; 'for myself I am mortal, and therefore fear to venture, but you who hold communion with disembodied spirits, may partake something of their nature, if so, you may pass without apprehension where the ghost has probably passed before.' They shrunk at this reproof, and were silent. The marquis, turning to a door on  his right hand, ordered it to be unlocked. 	7.0	3	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The Marquis leads some people to a tower, where they are afraid to go up the broken staircase. The Marquis mocks them and unlocks a door. 2: The events described are brief and take only a few minutes.  3: Let's say three minutes have elapsed. 4: 3 minutes. 5: High confidence.
6	RadcASR.txt|109|u	She was ordered to confine herself to her apartment till her innocence should be cleared, or her sister discovered. From Madame de Menon she received a faithful sympathy, which was the sole relief of her oppressed heart. Her anxiety concerning Julia daily encreased, and was heightened into the most terrifying apprehensions for her safety. She knew of no person in whom her sister could confide, or of  any place where she could find protection; the most deplorable evils were therefore to be expected. One day as she was sitting at the window of her apartment, engaged in melancholy reflection, she saw a man riding towards the castle on full speed. Her heart beat with fear and expectation, for his haste made her suspect he brought intelligence of Julia, and she could scarcely refrain from breaking through the command of the marquis, and rushing into the hall to learn something of his errand. She was right in her conjecture; the person she had seen was a spy of the marquis's, and came to inform him that the lady Julia was at that time concealed in a cottage of the forest of Marentino. The marquis rejoiced at this intelligence, and gave the man a liberal reward. He learned also, that she was accompanied by a young cavalier, which circumstance surprized him exceedingly, for he knew of no person  except the count de Vereza with whom she could have entrusted herself, and the count had fallen by his sword! He immediately ordered a party of his people to accompany the messenger to the forest of Marentino, and to suffer neither Julia nor the cavalier to escape them on pain of death. 	20160.0	1500	[2, 3, 1, 0]	VALID	1: A woman is confined to her apartment while her sister is missing. She fears for her sister's safety and sees a man riding towards the castle. The man is a spy of the marquis's and brings news that the sister is in a cottage in the forest of Marentino with a young cavalier. The marquis sends people to capture them.  2: The events of the passage are described in detail, but there is no explicit reference to time. However, the events described would take some time to happen: the woman is confined for an unknown period, and the spy has to ride to the castle. Let's say a day has passed since the woman was confined, and the spy takes an hour to ride to the castle.  3: One day and one hour have elapsed. That's 25 hours.  4: 1500 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

Corn, vineyards, olives, and groves of mulberry trees adorned the hills. The vallies, luxuriant in shade, were frequently embellished by the windings of a lucid stream, and diversified by clusters of half-seen cottages. Here the rising turrets of a monastery appeared above the thick trees with which they were surrounded; and there the savage wilds, the travellers had passed, formed a bold and picturesque back-ground to the scene. To the questions put by the duke to the several persons he met, he received answers that encouraged him to proceed. At noon he halted at a village to refresh himself and his people. He  could gain no intelligence of Julia, and was perplexed which way to chuse; but determined at length to pursue the road he was then in, and accordingly again set forward. He travelled several miles without meeting any person who could give the necessary information, and began to despair of success. 	360.0	240	[0, 2, 1, 3]	VALID	1: The Duke and his party travel through a picturesque landscape, asking people they meet about the fugitives they are pursuing. They stop at a village to rest and eat, but still have not found the fugitives. 2: The events described in the passage, including travel, asking questions, and stopping to eat, would have taken several hours. Let's say four hours. 3: Four hours have elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour, that's 240 minutes. 4: 240 minutes. 5: High confidence.
8	RadcASR.txt|137|u	He then assured them, that since indulgence had only encouraged intrusion, he would for the future be severe;  vere; and concluded with declaring, that the first man who should disturb him with a repetition of such ridiculous apprehensions, or should attempt to disturb the peace of the castle by circulating these idle notions, should be rigorously punished, and banished his dominions. They shrunk back at this reproof, and were silent. 'Bring a torch,' said the marquis, 'and shew me to the dungeon. I will once more condescend to confute you.' They obeyed, and descended with the marquis, who, arriving at the dungeon, instantly threw open the door, and discovered to the astonished eyes of his attendants Ferdinand! He started with surprize at the entrance of his father thus attended. The marquis darting upon him a severe look, which he perfectly comprehended 'Now,' cried he, turning to his people, 'what do you see? My son, whom I myself placed here, and whose voice, which  answered to your calls, you have transformed into unknown sounds. 'Speak, Ferdinand, and confirm what I say.' Ferdinand did so. 'What dreadful spectre appeared to you last night? Resumed the marquis, looking stedfastly upon him: gratify these fellows with a description of it, for they cannot exist without something of the marvelous.' 'None my lord,' replied Ferdinand, who too well understood the manner of the marquis. 'Tis well,' cried the marquis, 'and this is the last time,' turning to his attendants, 'that your folly shall be treated with so much lenity.' 	10.0	5	[3, 0, 1, 2]	VALID	1: The Marquis has been disturbed by rumors of a ghost in his castle. He has just discovered that the ghost is actually his son, Ferdinand, whom he had imprisoned in the dungeon. The Marquis is angry with his attendants for believing in ghosts and threatens to punish anyone who spreads such rumors in the future. 2: The passage describes a single event, the Marquis discovering his son in the dungeon. The conversation and actions described would have taken a few minutes at most. 3: Let's say 5 minutes have elapsed. 4: 5 minutes. 5: High confidence.
9	RadcASR.txt|148|u	She now opened the door, and to her inexpressible astonishment and distress, found the cottage empty. She proceeded to a small inner room, where lay a part of Julia's apparel. The bed had no appearance of having been slept in, and every moment served to heighten and confirm her apprehensions. While she pursued the search, she suddenly heard the trampling of feet at the cottage door, and presently after some people entered. Her fears for Julia now yielded to those for her own safety, and she was undetermined  whether to discover herself, or remain in her present situation, when she was relieved from her irresolution and distress by the appearance of Julia. On the return of the good woman, who had accompanied Madame to the village on the preceding night, Julia went to the cottage at Farrini. Her grateful heart would not suffer her to depart without taking leave of her faithful friends, thanking them for their kindness, and informing them of her future prospects. They had prevailed upon her to spend the few intervening hours at this cot, whence she had just risen to meet Madame. They now hastened to the spot where the horses were stationed,and commenced their journey. For some leagues they travelled in silence and thought, over a wild and picturesque country. The landscape was tinted with rich and variegated hues; and the autumnal lights, which streamed upon the hills, produced  a spirited and beautiful effect upon the scenery. All the glories of the vintage rose to their view: the purple grapes flushed through the dark green of the surrounding foliage, and the prospect glowed with warm luxuriance. 	222.0	90	[3, 0, 2, 1]	VALID	1: A woman enters a cottage and finds it empty, then checks a bedroom and finds no sign of anyone sleeping there. She hears people approaching and is relieved to see Julia, who had been spending time with friends. They travel together through a picturesque landscape. 2: The events in the cottage might take a few minutes, but the journey through the landscape would take at least an hour. Let's say an hour and a half to be safe. 3: 1.5 hours have elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour that's 90 minutes. 4: 90 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

To me they have, however, been unexpectedly dreadful in effect, and my heart assures me, that to you they will not be indifferent.' 'I am the unfortunate descendant of an ancient and illustrious Italian family. In early childhood I was deprived of a mother's care, but the tenderness of my surviving parent made her loss, as to my welfare, almost unfelt. Suffer me here to do justice to the character of my noble father. He united in an eminent degree, the mild virtues of social life, with the firm unbending qualities of the noble Romans, his ancesters, from whom he was proud to trace his descent. Their merit, indeed, continually dwelt on his tongue, and their actions he was always endeavouring to imitate, as far as was  consistent with the character of his times, and with the limited sphere in which he moved. The recollection of his virtue elevates my mind, and fills my heart with a noble pride, which even the cold walls of a monastery have not been able to subdue. My father's fortune was unsuitable to his rank. That his son might hereafter be enabled to support the dignity of his family, it was necessary for me to assume the veil. Alas! that heart was unfit to be offered at an heavenly shrine, which was already devoted to an earthly object. 	9986400.0	2628000	[0, 1, 2, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator explains that she is the descendant of an ancient and illustrious Italian family. Her father was a virtuous man who was always trying to imitate the actions of his noble ancestors. The narrator was forced to become a nun because her father's fortune was unsuitable to his rank, but she was in love with someone else. 2: The passage describes the narrator's childhood, her father's character, and her own feelings about her situation. It's difficult to estimate how much time has passed, but let's say that the narrator is at least in her late teens or early twenties when she becomes a nun. This would suggest that several years have passed since her childhood. The passage also suggests that the narrator has spent some time in a monastery, but it's unclear how long she has been there. Let's say that the events described in the passage took place over a period of five years. 3: Five years have elapsed. At 365 days a year that's 1825 days x 24 hours in a day, so 43800 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 2628000 minutes. 4: 2628000 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the estimate is based on a lot of speculation.
11	RadcASR.txt|174|u	The Abate was alone. His countenance was pale with anger, and he was pacing the room with slow but agitated steps. The stern authority of his look startled her. 'Read this letter,' said he, stretching forth his hand which held a letter, 'and tell me what that mortal deserves, who dares insult our holy order, and set our sacred prerogative at defiance.' Madame distinguished the hand writing of the marquis, and the words of the Superior threw her into the utmost astonishment. She took the  letter. It was dictated by that spirit of proud vindictive rage, which so strongly marked the character of the marquis. Having discovered the retreat of Julia, and believing the monastery afforded her a willing sanctuary from his pursuit, he accused the Abate of encouraging his child in open rebellion to his will. He loaded him and his sacred order with opprobrium, and threatened, if she was not immediately resigned to the emissaries in waiting, he would in person lead on a force which should compel the church to yield to the superior authority of the father. The spirit of the Abate was roused by this menace; and Julia obtained from his pride, that protection which neither his principle nor his humanity would have granted. 'The man shall tremble,' cried he,'who dares defy our power, or question our sacred authority. The lady Julia is safe. I will protect her from this proud invader of our  rights, and teach him at least to venerate the power he cannot conquer. I have dispatched his emissaries with my answer.' 	5.0	10	[1, 3, 0, 2]	VALID	1: The Abate is angry and shows Madame a letter from the Marquis, which accuses the Abate of encouraging his daughter to rebel against him. The Abate vows to protect Julia and has dispatched the Marquis's emissaries with his answer. 2: The events described in the passage are mostly mental and verbal, with the exception of the Abate pacing the room. This might take a few minutes. The letter from the Marquis might have arrived that day or the day before. Let's say 10 minutes. 3: 10 minutes. 4: 10 minutes. 5: High confidence.
12	RadcASR.txt|178|u	What punishment is adequate to guilt like this?'  The father paused his eyes sternly fixed on Julia, who pale and trembling, could scarcely support herself, and who had no power to reply. 'I will be merciful, and not just,' resumed he, 'I will soften the punishment you deserve, and will only deliver you to your father.' At these dreadful words, Julia bursting into tears, sunk at the feet of the Abate, to whom she raised her eyes in supplicating expression, but was unable to speak. He suffered her to remain in this posture. 'Your duplicity,' he resumed, 'is not the least of your offences. Had you relied upon our generosity for forgiveness and protection, an indulgence might have been granted; but under the disguise of virtue you concealed your crimes, and your necessities were hid beneath the mask of devotion.' These false aspersions roused in Julia the spirit of indignant virtue; she arose from her knees with an air of dignity,  that struck even the Abate. 'Holy father,' said she, 'my heart abhors the crime you mention, and disclaims all union with it. Whatever are my offences from the sin of hypocrisy I am at least free; and you will pardon me if I remind you, that my confidence has already been such, as fully justifies my claim to the protection I solicit. When I sheltered myself within these walls, it was to be presumed that they would protect me from injustice; and with what other term than injustice would you, Sir, distinguish the conduct of the marquis, if the fear of his power did not overcome the dictates of truth?' 	2.0	5	[0, 3, 1, 2]	VALID	1: A father is angry with Julia, who is pale and trembling. He accuses her of duplicity and hypocrisy, and says he will only deliver her to her father. Julia bursts into tears and sinks to the feet of the Abate. She then rises with an air of dignity and denies the accusations. 2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage. However, the events described involve a conversation and physical actions, which would take at least a few minutes. Let's say five minutes. 3: Five minutes have elapsed. 4: 5 minutes. 5: High confidence.
13	RadcASR.txt|183|u	Her lover sinking back, endeavoured to conceal his emotions, but the deep sobs which agitated his breast, betrayed his anguish, and the tears of every spectator bedewed the sacred spot where beauty, sense, and innocence expired. The organ now swelled in mournful harmony; and the voices of the assembly chanted in choral strain, a low and solemn requiem to the spirit of the departed. Madame hurried Julia, who was almost as lifeless as her departed friend, from the church. A death so sudden, heightened the grief which separation  would otherwise have occasioned. It was the nature of Cornelia's disorder, to wear a changeful but flattering aspect. Though she had long been declining, her decay was so gradual and imperceptible, as to lull the apprehensions of her friends into security. It was otherwise with herself; she was conscious of the change, but forbore to afflict them with the knowledge of the truth. The hour of her dissolution was sudden, even to herself; but it was composed, and even happy. In the death of Cornelia Julia seemed to mourn again that of Hippolitus. Her decease appeared to dissolve the last tie which connected her with his memory. In one of the friars of the convent, Madame was surprized to find the father who had confessed the dying Vincent. 	60.0	21600	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: Cornelia has died suddenly, and her lover and friends are mourning her at her funeral. Julia, who is with them, is reminded of the death of Hippolitus. Madame is surprised to find that one of the friars at the funeral is the same one who had given last rites to Vincent. 2: The passage describes a funeral, which would take at least an hour. There is also a reference to Cornelia's long illness, which might have lasted weeks or months. Let's say two months.  3: The range is from one hour to 43200 minutes (2 months). The midpoint is 21600 minutes. 4: 21600 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
14	RadcASR.txt|220|u	At length the tumult began to subside, and Hippolitus could distinguish what was said. The ruffians agreed to give up the lady in question to him who  had fought for her; and leaving him to his prize, they all went out in quest of farther prey. The situation of the unfortunate lady excited a mixture of pity and indignation in Hippolitus, which for some time entirely occupied him; he revolved the means of extricating her from so deplorable a situation, and in these thoughts almost forgot his own danger. He now heard her sighs; and while his heart melted to the sounds, the farther door of the apartment was thrown open, and the wretch to whom she had been allotted, rushed in. Her screams now redoubled, but they were of no avail with the ruffian who had seized her in his arms; when the count, who was unarmed, insensible to every impulse but that of a generous pity, burst into the room, but became fixed like a statue when he beheld his Julia struggling in the grasp of the ruffian. On discovering Hippolitus, she made a sudden spring, and liberated herself; when,  running to him, she sunk lifeless in his arms. Surprize and fury sparkled in the eyes of the ruffian, and he turned with a savage desperation upon the count; who, relinquishing Julia, snatched up the sword of the dead ruffian, which lay upon the floor, and defended himself. 	10.0	5	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: Hippolitus fights for a lady and wins her from a group of ruffians. He then hears her sighs and is about to help her when another ruffian enters the room. The lady screams, but Hippolitus rushes in and saves her.  2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but the events described would take at least a few minutes. Hippolitus has time to think about how to help the lady, and the ruffians have time to leave the room and find other prey. The fight between Hippolitus and the ruffian would also take some time. Let's say five minutes.  3: Five minutes have elapsed.  4: 5 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
15	RadcASR.txt|266|u	On the following morning Ferdinand returned with his friends to Palermo, where he first disclosed the late fatal events of the castle. They now settled their future plans; and Ferdinand hastened to the castle of Mazzini to fetch Emilia, and to give orders for the removal of his household to his palace at Naples, where he designed to fix his future residence. The distress of Emilia, whom he found recovered from her indisposition, yielded to joy and wonder, when she heard of the existence of her mother, and the safety of her sister. She departed with Ferdinand for Palermo, where her friends awaited her, and where the joy of the meeting was considerably heightened by the appearance  of Madame de Menon, for whom the marchioness had dispatched a messenger to St. Augustin's. Madame had quitted the abbey for another convent, to which however the messenger was directed. This happy party now embarked for Naples. From this period the castle of Mazzini, which had been the theatre of a dreadful catastrophe, and whose scenes would have revived in the minds of the chief personages connected with it, painful and shocking recollections was abandoned. On their arrival at Naples, Ferdinand presented to the king a clear and satisfactory account of the late events at the castle, in consequence of which the marchioness was confirmed in her rank, and Ferdinand was received as the sixth marquis de Mazzini. 	40320.0	7200	[3, 0, 1, 2]	VALID	1: Ferdinand and his friends return to Palermo, where they plan to move to Naples. Ferdinand goes to the castle of Mazzini to fetch Emilia and arrange for the household's removal. Emilia is overjoyed to hear of her mother's existence and her sister's safety. They all travel to Naples, where Ferdinand presents an account of the recent events at the castle to the king, and is confirmed as the sixth marquis de Mazzini. 2: There are several events described, but none of them are described in detail. We can guess that the journey from Palermo to the castle of Mazzini would take at least a day, and that the journey from the castle to Naples would take at least another day. There is also some time implied in the process of presenting an account to the king and being confirmed as the marquis de Mazzini. Altogether, these events probably took at least three days, and possibly as many as ten. 3: Let's say five days have elapsed. At 24 hours a day that's 120 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 7200 minutes. 4: 7200 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because of the amount of speculation required.
16	RadcASR.txt|267|u	The marchioness, thus restored to the world, and to happiness, resided with her children in the palace at Naples, where, after time had somewhat  mellowed the remembrance of the late calamity, the nuptials of Hippolitus and Julia were celebrated. The recollection of the difficulties they had encountered, and of the distress they had endured for each other, now served only to heighten by contrast the happiness of the present period. Ferdinand soon after accepted a command in the Neapolitan army; and amidst the many heroes of that warlike and turbulent age, distinguished himself for his valour and ability. The occupations of war engaged his mind, while his heart was occupied in promoting the happiness of his family. Madame de Menon, whose generous attachment to the marchioness had been fully proved, found in the restoration of her friend a living witness of her marriage, and thus recovered those estates which had been unjustly with-held from her. But the marchioness and her family, grateful to her friendship, and attached  to her virtues, prevailed upon her to spend the remainder of her life at the palace of Mazzini. Emilia, wholly attached to her family, continued to reside with the marchioness, who saw her race renewed in the children of Hippolitus and Julia. Thus surrounded by her children and friends, and engaged in forming the minds of the infant generation, she seemed to forget that she had ever been otherwise than happy.' Here the manuscript annals conclude. In reviewing this story, we perceive a singular and striking instance of moral retribution. We learn also, that those who do only THAT WHICH IS RIGHT, endure nothing in misfortune but a trial of their virtue, and from trials well endured, derive the surest claim to the protection of heaven. FINIS.       	13140000.0	1576800	[0, 3, 1, 2]	VALID	1: The passage describes the happy ending of a story, including the marriage of two characters, the military career of another, and the return of a friend's estates.  2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but it does describe a series of events that would have taken some time to occur. The marriage of Hippolitus and Julia, for example, would have required some time for planning and preparation. Similarly, Ferdinand's military career would have taken some time to unfold. Let's say that the events described in the passage took place over the course of a few years.  3: Let's say that the events described in the passage took place over the course of three years. At 365 days a year that's 1095 days x 24 hours in a day, so 26280 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 1576800 minutes. 4: 1576800 minutes. 5: Low confidence, since the estimate is based on speculation.

Now, while these memories and associations are fresh in my mind, wilt come with me, dear reader, to this sweet spot? wilt recline 'neath the sheltering branches of these noble trees? wilt place thy hand cordially in mine, and lend me thy sympathy and thy heart? and, while the birds are warbling their love songs over thy head, and the rainbow tinted fountain dashes its delicate and cooling spray about thy feet, — while the fleecy clouds rest lightly in the southern heavens, and the distant hum of the busy city, together with the far off murmuring of waters, lull thy senses to forgetfulness of care, — wilt listen to my simple tale? 1* 6 BOSTON COMMON. I was born in a little country village, not many hundred miles from the city of Boston. It is due to my parents to say something of them in this place. My father was an Englishman, of a proud old stock, who came from the county of Kent, England, to this country, many years before my birth. His father sent him to college, when quite young, to acquire a thorough classical education. He was destined for the bar; but, happening to meet with a pretty young lady soon after his entrance, he became unfortunately enamoured of her.

Over the entrance doors, which would have let in a troop of Indian elephants, there was a broad stained-glass panel showing a knight in dark armor rescuing a lady who was tied to a tree and didn't have any clothes on but some very long and convenient hair. The knight had pushed the vizor of his helmet back to be sociable, and he was fiddling with the knots on the ropes that tied the lady to the tree and not getting anywhere.

Above the mantel there was a large oil portrait, and above the portrait two bullet-torn or moth-eaten cavalry pennants crossed in a glass frame. The portrait was a stiffly posed job of an officer in full regimentals of about the time of the Mexican war. The officer had a neat black imperial, black mustachios, hot hard coal-black eyes, and the general look of a man it would pay to get along with.

The butler went away among the abominable plants. The General spoke again, slowly, using his strength as carefully as an out-of-work show-girl uses her last good pair of stockings.  “I used to like mine with champagne. The champagne as cold as Valley Forge and about a third of a glass of brandy beneath it. You may take your coat off, sir. It's too hot in here for a man with blood in his veins.”  I stood up and peeled off my coat and got a handkerchief out and mopped my face and neck and the backs of my wrists. St. Louis in August had nothing on that place. I sat down again and I felt automatically for a cigarette and then stopped. The old man caught the gesture and smiled faintly.  “You may smoke, sir. I like the smell of tobacco.”  I lit the cigarette and blew a lungful at him and he sniffed at it like a terrier at a rathole. The faint smile pulled at the shadowed corners of his mouth. 	2.0	2	[0, 2, 1, 3]	VALID	1: A man named Marlowe meets an old man, the General, who is initially unresponsive. The butler brings Marlowe a chair and takes his hat. The General asks how Marlowe likes his brandy and reminisces about how he used to drink it. The butler goes away. The General tells Marlowe to take off his coat and offers him a cigarette. Marlowe lights the cigarette and the General smiles faintly. 2: Marlowe sits down, takes off his coat, and mops his face and neck and the backs of his wrists. He also feels for a cigarette before remembering the General's preferences. These actions would take a minute or two. The General speaks slowly and carefully, suggesting he is frail and may need more time to speak than he used to. The butler takes Marlowe's hat with a 'deft scoop,' suggesting he is experienced and efficient. The General reminisces about how he used to drink his brandy, which suggests that he is elderly and has been retired for some time.  3: Two minutes have elapsed.  4: 2 minutes. 5: High confidence.

She took a swallow from it and gave me a cool level stare over the rim of the glass.  “So you're a private detective,” she said. “I didn't know they really existed, except in books. Or else they were greasy little men snooping around hotels.”  There was nothing in that for me, so I let it drift with the current. She put her glass down on the flat arm of the chaise-longue and flashed an emerald and touched her hair. She said slowly: “How did you like Dad?”  “I liked him,” I said.  “He liked Rusty. I suppose you know who Rusty is?”  “Uh-huh.”  “Rusty was earthy and vulgar at times, but he was very real. And he was a lot of fun for Dad. Rusty shouldn't have gone off like that. Dad feels very badly about it, although he won't say so. Or did he?”  “He said something about it.”  “You're not much of a gusher, are you, Mr. Marlowe? But he wants to find him, doesn't he?”  I stared at her politely through a pause. “Yes and no,” I said. 	1.0	1	[2, 3, 0, 1]	VALID	1: A private detective meets a woman who asks him about his profession and then asks him about his opinion of her father and Rusty. She asks if her father wants to find Rusty. 2: The events described in the passage are mostly dialogue, which can happen quickly. However, the woman takes a drink and touches her hair, which might take a few seconds. The detective also pauses before answering her question.

37	thebigsleep.txt|22|u	     FOUR  A. G. Geiger's place was a store frontage on the north side of the boulevard near Las Palmas. The entrance door was set far back in the middle and there was a copper trim on the windows, which were backed with Chinese screens, so I couldn't see into the store. There was a lot of oriental junk in the windows. I didn't know whether it was any good, not being a collector of antiques, except unpaid bills. The entrance door was plate glass, but I couldn't see much through that either, because the store was very dim. A building entrance adjoined it on one side and on the other was a glittering credit jewelry establishment. The jeweler stood in his entrance, teetering on his heels and looking bored, a tall handsome white-haired Jew in lean dark clothes, with about nine carats of diamond on his right hand. A faint knowing smile curved his lips when I turned into Geiger's store. I let the door close softly behind me and walked on a thick blue rug that paved the floor from wall to wall. There were blue leather easy chairs with smoke stands beside them. A few sets of tooled leather bindings were set out on narrow polished tables, between book ends. There were more tooled bindings in glass cases on the walls. Nice-looking merchandise, the kind a rich promoter would buy by the yard and have somebody paste his bookplate in. At the back there was a grained wood partition with a door in the middle of it, shut. In the corner made by the partition and one wall a woman sat behind a small desk with a carved wooden lantern on it. 	1.0	300	[3, 2, 1, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator describes a store called A. G. Geiger's place, including the exterior and interior decor, and a woman sitting behind a desk. 2: The narrator takes time to observe and describe the store, including the exterior and interior decor, and a woman sitting behind a desk.

The local law in your pocket and a well-greased line into L.A. In other words, protection. Geiger was in a racket that needed that too. Perhaps you spared him a little now and then, seeing he's your tenant.”  His mouth became a hard white grimace. “Geiger was in what racket?”  “The smut book racket.”  He stared at me for a long level minute. “Somebody got to him,” he said softly. “You know something about it. He didn't show at the store today. They don't know where he is. He didn't answer the phone here. I came up to see about it. I find blood on the floor, under a rug. And you and a girl here.”  “A little weak,” I said. “But maybe you can sell the story to a willing buyer. You missed a little something, though. Somebody moved his books out of the store today—the nice books he rented out.”  He snapped his fingers sharply and said: “I should have thought of that, soldier. You seem to get around. How do you figure it?”  “I think Geiger was rubbed. I think that is his blood. And the books being moved out gives a motive for hiding the body for a while. Somebody is taking over the racket and wants a little time to organize.”  “They can't get away with it,” Eddie Mars said grimly. 	3.0	5	[1, 3, 2, 0]	VALID	1: A man named Eddie Mars confronts the narrator about the disappearance of a man named Geiger. The narrator suggests that Geiger was killed and his books stolen, and that someone is taking over Geiger's business.  2: The passage describes a conversation, which would take at least a few minutes.

He said very quietly: “You haven't had to tell any of my men where to put their feet, smart guy.”  “We'll see about that,” Ohls said. “This chauffeur I spoke of that's drowned off Lido shot a guy last night in your territory. A guy named Geiger who ran a dirty book racket in a store on Hollywood Boulevard. Geiger was living with the punk I got outside in my car. I mean living with him, if you get the idea.”  Cronjager was staring at him levelly now. “That sounds like it might grow up to be a dirty story,” he said.  “It's my experience most police stories are,” Ohls growled and turned to me, his eyebrows bristling. “You're on the air, Marlowe. Give it to him.”  I gave it to him.  I left out two things, not knowing just why, at the moment, I left out one of them. I left out Carmen's visit to Brody's apartment and Eddie Mars' visit to Geiger's in the afternoon. I told the rest of it just as it happened.  Cronjager never took his eyes off my face and no expression of any kind crossed his as I talked. At the end of it he was perfectly silent for a long minute. Wilde was silent, sipping his coffee, puffing gently at his dappled cigar. Ohls stared at one of his thumbs. 	7.0	7.5	[3, 0, 1, 2]	VALID	1: A group of men are discussing a recent murder. Ohls, a police officer, has just told Cronjager, a gangster, about the murder of a man named Geiger. Marlowe, the narrator, then tells Cronjager the story of the murder. Cronjager listens silently. 2: The events described in the passage are a conversation and a story being told. Even though the story is being told in detail, it probably only takes a few minutes to recount. The conversation itself might take longer, but it's hard to say how long. Let's say the conversation takes 10 minutes and the story takes 5 minutes.  3: 7.5 minutes have elapsed.  4: 7.5 minutes. 5: High confidence.
40	thebigsleep.txt|138|u	 I read all three of the morning papers over my eggs and bacon the next morning. Their accounts of the affair came as close to the truth as newspaper stories usually come—as close as Mars is to Saturn. None of the three connected Owen Taylor, driver of the Lido Pier Suicide Car, with the Laurel Canyon Exotic Bungalow Slaying. None of them mentioned the Sternwoods, Bernie Ohls or me. Owen Taylor was “chauffeur to a wealthy family.” Captain Cronjager of the Hollywood Division got all the credit for solving the two slayings in his district, which were supposed to arise out of a dispute over the proceeds from a wire service maintained by one Geiger in the back of the bookstore on Hollywood Boulevard. Brody had shot Geiger and Carol Lundgren had shot Brody in revenge. Police were holding Carol Lundgren in custody. He had confessed. He had a bad record—probably in high school. Police were also holding one Agnes Lozelle, Geiger's secretary, as a material witness.  It was a nice write-up. It gave the impression that Geiger had been killed the night before, that Brody had been killed about an hour later, and that Captain Cronjager had solved both murders while lighting a cigarette. The suicide of Taylor made Page One of Section II. There was a photo of the sedan on the deck of the power lighter, with the license plate blacked out, and something covered with a cloth lying on the deck beside the running board. Owen Taylor had been despondent and in poor health. His family lived in Dubuque, and his body would be shipped there. There would be no inquest. 	60.0	2160	[0, 1, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The protagonist reads three newspapers over breakfast, all of which have inaccurate accounts of the previous day's events.  2: The protagonist reads three newspapers, which would take at least 30 minutes. The newspapers are reporting on events that happened the previous day, so we can add another day to that.  3: 1.5 days have elapsed.

41	thebigsleep.txt|161|u	 “Something the matter, Mrs. Regan?”  She turned her face to him with a sort of lunge. I saw the curve of her cheek stiffen, as if with an almost unbearable inner tautness. She didn't answer him.  Eddie Mars said gravely: “If you're not playing any more, you must let me send someone home with you.”  The girl flushed. Her cheekbones stood out white in her face. Then she laughed off-key. She said bitterly:  “One more play, Eddie. Everything I have on the red. I like red. It's the color of blood.”  Eddie Mars smiled faintly, then nodded and reached into his inner breast pocket. He drew out a large pinseal wallet with gold corners and tossed it carelessly along the table to the croupier. “Cover her bet in even thousands,” he said, “if no one objects to this turn of the wheel being just for the lady.”  No one objected, Vivian Regan leaned down and pushed all her winnings savagely with both hands on to the large red diamond on the layout.  The croupier leaned over the table without haste. He counted and stacked her money and chips, placed all but a few chips and bills in a neat pile and pushed the rest back off the layout with his rake. He opened Eddie Mars' wallet and drew out two flat packets of thousand-dollar bills. He broke one, counted six bills out, added them to the unbroken packet, put the four loose bills in the wallet and laid it aside as carelessly as if it had been a packet of matches. Eddie Mars didn't touch the wallet. Nobody moved except the croupier. He spun the wheel left-handed and sent the ivory ball skittering along the upper edge with a casual flirt of his wrist. Then he drew his hands back and folded his arms. 	2.0	5	[2, 3, 0, 1]	VALID	1: A woman named Vivian Regan is gambling with a man named Eddie Mars. She makes a bet and wins, and the croupier counts out her winnings and Eddie Mars' money.  2: The events described in the passage are relatively brief, but there is some ambiguity about how long it would take to count out and exchange large sums of money. Let's say the whole process takes five minutes.  3: Five minutes have elapsed.  4: 5 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.

TWENTY-THREE  Light steps, the steps of a woman, came along the invisible pathway and the man in front of me moved forward and seemed to lean against the fog. I couldn't see the woman, then I could see her indistinctly. The arrogant carriage of her head seemed familiar. The man stepped out very quickly. The two figures blended in the fog, seemed to be part of the fog. There was dead silence for a moment. Then the man said:  “This is a gun, lady. Gentle now. Sound carries in the fog. Just hand me the bag.”  The girl didn't make a sound. I moved forward a step. Quite suddenly I could see the foggy fuzz on the man's hat brim. The girl stood motionless. Then her breathing began to make a rasping sound, like a small file on soft wood.  “Yell,” the man said, “and I'll cut you in half.”  She didn't yell. She didn't move. There was a movement from him, and a dry chuckle. “It better be in here,” he said. A catch clicked and a fumbling sound came to me. The man turned and came towards my tree. When he had taken three or four steps he chuckled again. The chuckle was something out of my own memories. I reached a pipe out of my pocket and held it like a gun. 	4.0	0.25	[2, 3, 0, 1]	VALID	1: A man and a woman meet in the fog. The man threatens the woman with a gun and demands a bag. The protagonist watches from behind a tree and holds a pipe like a gun. 2: The events described are brief and take place in a matter of seconds. However, the protagonist also has time to reflect on the situation and reach for a pipe. This might take an additional 10-20 seconds.  3: Let's say 15 seconds have elapsed.  4: 15 seconds. 5: High confidence.
44	thebigsleep.txt|198|u	 I thought about it most of the day. Nobody came into the office. Nobody called me on the phone. It kept on raining.      TWENTY-SIX  At seven the rain had stopped for a breathing spell, but the gutters were still flooded. On Santa Monica the water was level with the sidewalk and a thin film of it washed over the top of the curbing. A traffic cop in shining black rubber from boots to cap sloshed through the flood on his way from the shelter of a sodden awning. My rubber heels slithered on the sidewalk as I turned into the narrow lobby of the Fulwider Building. A single drop light burned far back, beyond an open, once gilt elevator. There was a tarnished and well-missed spittoon on a gnawed rubber mat. A case of false teeth hung on the mustard-colored wall like a fuse box in a screen porch. I shook the rain off my hat and looked at the building directory beside the case of teeth. Numbers with names and numbers without names. Plenty of vacancies or plenty of tenants who wished to remain anonymous. Painless dentists, shyster detective agencies, small sick businesses that had crawled there to die, mail order schools that would teach you how to become a railroad clerk or a radio technician or a screen writer—if the postal inspectors didn't catch up with them first. A nasty building. A building in which the smell of stale cigar butts would be the cleanest odor. 	1440.0	10	[1, 2, 0, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator spends most of the day thinking about something, and then goes to a building that he describes in detail. 2: The narrator spends most of the day thinking, but we don't know how long that is.

45	thebigsleep.txt|199|u	 An old man dozed in the elevator, on a ramshackle stool, with a burst-out cushion under him. His mouth was open, his veined temples glistened in the weak light. He wore a blue uniform coat that fitted him the way a stall fits a horse. Under that gray trousers with frayed cuffs, white cotton socks and black kid shoes, one of which was slit across a bunion. On the stool he slept miserably, waiting for a customer. I went past him softly, the clandestine air of the building prompting me, found the fire door and pulled it open. The fire stairs hadn't been swept in a month. Bums had slept on them, eaten on them, left crusts and fragments of greasy newspaper, matches, a gutted imitation-leather pocketbook. In a shadowy angle against the scribbled wall a pouched ring of pale rubber had fallen and had not been disturbed. A very nice building.  I came out at the fourth floor sniffing for air. The hallway had the same dirty spittoon and frayed mat, the same mustard walls, the same memories of low tide. I went down the line and turned a corner. The name: “L. D. Walgreen—Insurance,” showed on a dark pebbled glass door, on a second dark door, on a third behind which there was a light. One of the dark doors said: “Entrance.”  A glass transom was open above the lighted door. Through it the sharp bird-like voice of Harry Jones spoke, saying:  “Canino? . . . Yeah, I've seen you around somewhere. Sure.”  I froze. The other voice spoke. It had a heavy purr, like a small dynamo behind a brick wall. It said: “I thought you would.” There was a vaguely sinister note in that voice. 	2.0	300	[2, 0, 1, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator enters a building and climbs the stairs to the fourth floor. He passes a sleeping elevator operator and notes the filth on the stairs. He arrives at a door marked 'L. D. Walgreen—Insurance' and hears two men talking inside. 2: Climbing four flights of stairs would take at least a few minutes, as would observing the elevator operator and the state of the stairs. The narrator also takes time to listen to the conversation inside the office. Let's say five minutes. 3: Five minutes have elapsed. Multiplying by 60 minutes in an hour, that's 300 minutes. 4: 300 minutes. 5: High confidence.
46	thebigsleep.txt|211|u	They turned off on this road and Joe swung around and went back and we saw the car turn off the road where the frame house was. We sat there half an hour looking through the cars going by. Nobody came back out. When it was quite dark Joe sneaked up there and took a look. He said there were lights in the house and a radio was going and just the one car out in front, the coupe. So we beat it.”  She stopped talking and I listened to the swish of tires on Wilshire. I said: “They might have shifted quarters since then but that's what you have to sell—that's what you have to sell. Sure you knew her?”  “If you ever see her, you won't make a mistake the second time. Good-bye, copper, and wish me luck. I got a raw deal.”  “Like hell you did,” I said, and walked away across the street to my own car.  The gray Plymouth moved forward, gathered speed, and darted around the corner onto Sunset Place. The sound of its motor died, and with it blonde Agnes wiped herself off the slate for good, so far as I was concerned. Three men dead, Geiger, Brody and Harry Jones, and the woman went riding off in the rain with my two hundred in her bag and not a mark on her. I kicked my starter and drove on downtown to eat. I ate a good dinner. Forty miles in the rain is a hike, and I hoped to make it a round trip. 	60.0	120	[2, 0, 1, 3]	VALID	1: Joe and the narrator watch a car turn off the road and into a house. They wait for half an hour, then Joe sneaks up to the house and sees lights and hears a radio. They leave. The narrator then reflects on the woman they were looking for and the people who have died.  2: Joe spends some time sneaking up to the house and looking around, but it's not clear how long this takes. Waiting for half an hour and driving forty miles would take at least an hour and a half. The narrator also eats dinner, which would take at least half an hour.  3: Let's say two hours have elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour, that's 120 minutes. 4: 120 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

Does Norris know?” “He'll never tell.” “I thought he knew.” I went quickly away from her down the room and out and down the tiled staircase to the front hall. I didn't see anybody when I left. I found my hat alone this time. Outside the bright gardens had a haunted look, as though small wild eyes were watching me from behind the bushes, as though the sunshine itself had a mysterious something in its light. I got into my car and drove off down the hill.	3.0	10	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The protagonist decides to rest before confronting Eddie. He asks if Norris knows about the situation, then leaves the room and the house. He finds his hat and drives away. 2: The protagonist's actions are described in detail, but there is no explicit reference to time. Let's say that the protagonist's actions take about 10 minutes. 3: 10 minutes have elapsed. 4: 10 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

You were dead, you were sleeping the big sleep, you were not bothered by things like that. Oil and water were the same as wind and air to you. You just slept the big sleep, not caring about the nastiness of how you died or where you fell. Me, I was part of the nastiness now. Far more a part of it than Rusty Regan was. But the old man didn't have to be. He could lie quiet in his canopied bed, with his bloodless hands folded on the sheet, waiting. His heart was a brief, uncertain murmur. His thoughts were as gray as ashes. And in a little while he too, like Rusty Regan, would be sleeping the big sleep.    On the way downtown I stopped at a bar and had a couple of double Scotches. They didn't do me any good. All they did was make me think of Silver-Wig, and I never saw her again. 	60.0	60	[1, 2, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator reflects on death and then goes to a bar and drinks two double Scotches.  2: The reflection on death is abstract and doesn't describe any events, so we can't say how much time it took. The stop at the bar and the drinking of two double Scotches would take at least 20 minutes, but could take longer depending on how long the narrator lingered.  3: Let's say the stop at the bar took half an hour. 30 minutes x 2 = 60 minutes. 4: 60 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
49	ElliRI.txt|0|u	Prologue   I am an invisible man. No, I am not a spook like those who haunted Edgar Allan Poe; nor am I one of your Hollywood-movie ectoplasms. I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and liquids—and I might even be said to possess a mind. I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me. Like the bodiless heads you see sometimes in circus sideshows, it is as though I have been surrounded by mirrors of hard, distorting glass. When they approach me they see only my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their imagination—indeed, everything and anything except me.  Nor is my invisibility exactly a matter of a biochemical accident to my epidermis. That invisibility to which I refer occurs because of a peculiar disposition of the eyes of those with whom I come in contact. A matter of the construction of their inner eyes, those eyes with which they look through their physical eyes upon reality. I am not complaining, nor am I protesting either. It is sometimes advantageous to be unseen, although it is most often rather wearing on the nerves. Then too, you're constantly being bumped against by those of poor vision. Or again, you often doubt if you really exist. You wonder whether you aren't simply a phantom in other people's minds. Say, a figure in a nightmare which the sleeper tries with all his strength to destroy. It's when you feel like this that, out of resentment, you begin to bump people back. And, let me confess, you feel that way most of the time. You ache with the need to convince yourself that you do exist in the real world, that you're a part of all the sound and anguish, and you strike out with your fists, you curse and you swear to make them recognize you. And, alas, it's seldom successful. 	13140000.0	3	[0, 1, 2, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator describes his experience of being invisible, and the psychological and physical effects it has on him. 2: The passage describes a state of being rather than events, but the narrator does describe some actions he takes, such as striking out with his fists. Let's say that the passage describes a few minutes of the narrator's experience. 3: Let's say three minutes have elapsed. 4: 3 minutes. 5: High confidence.
50	ElliRI.txt|1|u	 One night I accidentally bumped into a man, and perhaps because of the near darkness he saw me and called me an insulting name. I sprang at him, seized his coat lapels and demanded that he apologize. He was a tall blond man, and as my face came close to his he looked insolently out of his blue eyes and cursed me, his breath hot in my face as he struggled. I pulled his chin down sharp upon the crown of my head, butting him as I had seen the West Indians do, and I felt his flesh tear and the blood gush out, and I yelled, “Apologize! Apologize!” But he continued to curse and struggle, and I butted him again and again until he went down heavily, on his knees, profusely bleeding. I kicked him repeatedly, in a frenzy because he still uttered insults though his lips were frothy with blood. Oh yes, I kicked him! And in my outrage I got out my knife and prepared to slit his throat, right there beneath the lamplight in the deserted street, holding him in the collar with one hand, and opening the knife with my teeth—when it occurred to me that the man had not seen me, actually; that he, as far as he knew, was in the midst of a walking nightmare! And I stopped the blade, slicing the air as I pushed him away, letting him fall back to the street.	3.0	240	[1, 2, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator describes a violent encounter with a man in the street, in which he butts and kicks the man and prepares to slit his throat before realizing that the man has not seen him and is not aware of his presence.  2: The events described would take at least a few minutes, even if the narrator's perception of time is distorted by the intensity of the experience. Let's say three to five minutes.  3: Four minutes have elapsed. Multiplying by 60 minutes per hour, that's 240 minutes.  4: 240 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.

And the white family that owned the land when it was a big plantation still lives in town.”  “Yes,” he said, “I know that many of the old families still survive. And individuals too, the human stock goes on, even though it degenerates. But these cabins!” He seemed surprised and confounded.  “Do you suppose those women know anything about the age and history of the place? The older one looks as though she might.”  “I doubt it, sir. They—they don't seem very bright.”  “Bright?” he said, removing his cigar. “You mean that they wouldn't talk with me?” he asked suspiciously.  “Yes, sir. That's it.”  “Why not?”  I didn't want to explain. It made me feel ashamed, but he sensed that I knew something and pressed me.  “It's not very nice, sir. But I don't think those women would talk to us.”  “We can explain that we're from the school. Surely they'll talk then. You may tell them who I am.”  “Yes, sir,” I said, “but they hate us up at the school. They never come there …”  “What!”  “No, sir.”  “And those children along the fence down there?”  “They don't either, sir.”  “But why?”  “I don't really know, sir. Quite a few folks out this way don't, though. I guess they're too ignorant. They're not interested.”  “But I can't believe it.”  The children had stopped playing and now looked silently at the car, their arms behind their backs and their new oversized overalls pulled tight over their little pot bellies as though they too were pregnant. 	2.0	10	[0, 1, 3, 2]	VALID	1: A man and a narrator are looking at some cabins that were built during slavery times. The man is surprised that they are still standing and asks if the women who live there know anything about the history of the place. The narrator is hesitant to explain why the women might not talk to them, but eventually says that they hate people from the school. The man is surprised and doesn't believe it.  2: The events described in the passage are mostly a conversation between two people, with some observations of the cabins and the children playing nearby.

The girls and drunken vets were stumbling about with drinks in their hands. Just as we went past an open door Edna saw us and grabbed my arm.  “Where you taking white-folks?” she demanded.  “Back to school,” I said, shaking her off.  “You don't want to go up there, white-folks, baby,” she said. I tried to push past her. “I ain't lying,” she said. “I'm the best little home-maker in the business.”  “Okay, but please let us alone,” I pleaded. “You'll get me into trouble.”  We were going down the stairs into the milling men now and she started to scream, “Pay me then! If he's too good for me, let him pay!”  And before I could stop her she had pushed Mr. Norton, and both of us were stumbling swiftly down the stairs. I landed against a man who looked up with the anonymous familiarity of a drunk and shoved me hard away. I saw Mr. Norton spin past as I sank farther into the crowd. Somewhere I could hear the girl screaming and Halley's voice yelling, “Hey! Hey! Hey, now!” Then I was aware of fresh air and saw that I was near the door and pushed my way free and stood panting and preparing to plunge back for Mr. Norton—when I heard Halley calling, “Make way y'all!” and saw him piloting Mr. Norton to the door. 	1.6	3	[0, 1, 2, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator and Mr. Norton are trying to leave a noisy balcony, but are stopped by a woman named Edna. She tries to convince them not to go upstairs, and when they try to leave, she pushes Mr. Norton down the stairs. The narrator gets separated from Mr. Norton in the crowd, but eventually finds him being helped out by Halley. 2: The events described in the passage take place in a relatively short amount of time, perhaps a few minutes at most. The narrator and Mr. Norton are trying to leave the balcony, but are stopped by Edna, and then pushed down the stairs. The narrator gets separated from Mr. Norton in the crowd, but eventually finds him being helped out by Halley.  3: Let's say three minutes have elapsed.  4: 3 minutes. 5: High confidence.
53	ElliRI.txt|170|u	 Uttering apologies, Dr. Bledsoe helped him to his chair. Then as the old man rested back with a smile, Dr. Bledsoe walked to the edge of the platform and lifted his arms. I closed my eyes as I heard the deep moaning sound that issued from him, and the rising crescendo of the student body joining in. This time it was music sincerely felt, not rendered for the guests, but for themselves; a song of hope and exaltation. I wanted to rush from the building, but didn't dare. I sat stiff and erect, supported by the hard bench, relying upon it as upon a form of hope.  I could not look at Dr. Bledsoe now, because old Barbee had made me both feel my guilt and accept it. For although I had not intended it, any act that endangered the continuity of the dream was an act of treason.  I did not listen to the next speaker, a tall white man who kept dabbing at his eyes with a handkerchief and repeating his phrases in an emotional and inarticulate manner. Then the orchestra played excerpts from Dvořák's New World Symphony and I kept hearing “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot” resounding through its dominant theme—my mother's and grandfather's favorite spiritual. It was more than I could stand, and before the next speaker could begin I hurried past the disapproving eyes of teachers and matrons, out into the night. 	30.0	90	[1, 0, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator attends a college event where Dr. Bledsoe speaks and the student body sings. The narrator feels guilty and leaves early. 2: The events described in the passage take place over the course of a college event, which could last several hours. The narrator also mentions hearing a speaker before leaving, which suggests that some time has passed. Let's say the event lasted three hours and the narrator left halfway through.  3: 1.5 hours have elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour, that's 90 minutes. 4: 90 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
54	ElliRI.txt|233|u	 “Yes. That's a way of putting it. Because to help you I must disillusion you …”  “Oh, I don't think I mind, sir. Once I see Mr. Emerson, it'll be up to me. All I want to do is speak to him.”  “Speak to him,” he said, getting quickly to his feet and mashing his cigarette into the tray with shaking fingers. “No one speaks to him. He does the speaking—” Suddenly he broke off. “On second thought, perhaps you'd better leave me your address and I'll mail you Mr. Emerson's reply in the morning. He's really a very busy man.”  His whole manner had changed.  “But you said …” I stood up, completely confused. Was he having fun with me? “Couldn't you let me talk to him for just five minutes?” I pleaded. “I'm sure I can convince him that I'm worthy of a job. And if there's someone who has tampered with my letter, I'll prove my identity … Dr. Bledsoe would—”  “Identity! My God! Who has any identity anymore anyway? It isn't so perfectly simple. Look,” he said with an anguished gesture. “Will you trust me?”  “Why, yes, sir, I trust you.”  He leaned forward. “Look,” he said, his face working violently, “I was trying to tell you that I know many things about you—not you personally, but fellows like you. Not much, either, but still more than the average. With us it's still Jim and Huck Finn.	1.4	7.0	[2, 0, 1, 3]	VALID	1: A young man is trying to speak to Mr. Emerson, but the man he is speaking to is trying to dissuade him. The man then changes his mind and offers to mail Mr. Emerson's reply to the young man. 2: The events described in the passage take place in a conversation, which would take a few minutes. The young man also pleads with the man to let him speak to Mr. Emerson for five minutes, which would take an additional few minutes. Let's say the conversation takes five minutes and the pleading takes another two minutes. 3: Seven minutes have elapsed. At 60 seconds a minute, that's 420 seconds. 4: 420 seconds. 5: High confidence.
55	ElliRI.txt|263|u	 Running the rag over a gauge I wondered how an apparently uneducated old man could gain such a responsible job. He certainly didn't sound like an engineer; yet he alone was on duty. And you could never be sure, for at home an old man employed as a janitor at the Water Works was the only one who knew the location of all of the water mains. He had been employed at the beginning, before any records were kept, and actually functioned as an engineer though he drew a janitor's pay. Perhaps this old Brockway was protecting himself from something. After all, there was antagonism to our being employed. Maybe he was dissimulating, like some of the teachers at the college, who, to avoid trouble when driving through the small surrounding towns, wore chauffeur caps and pretended that their cars belonged to white men. But why was he pretending with me? And what was his job?  I looked around me. It was not just an engine room; I knew, for I had been in several, the last at college. It was something more. For one thing, the furnaces were made differently and the flames that flared through the cracks of the fire chambers were too intense and too blue. And there were the odors. No, he was making something down here, something that had to do with paint, and probably something too filthy and dangerous for white men to be willing to do even for money. It was not paint because I had been told that the paint was made on the floors above, where, passing through, I had seen men in splattered aprons working over large vats filled with whirling pigment. One thing was certain: I had to be careful with this crazy Brockway; he didn't like my being here … And there he was, entering the room now from the stairs. 	1.2	10	[0, 1, 2, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator is in an engine room, wondering about the job of an old man named Brockway who seems to be in charge. The narrator speculates that Brockway might be hiding something, and that the engine room might be used for making something dangerous and dirty. 2: The narrator spends some time looking around the engine room and thinking about Brockway's job. This probably takes at least 10 minutes. 3: 10 minutes. 4: 10 minutes. 5: High confidence.
56	ElliRI.txt|266|u	 “Oh, sho, sho,” he said. “Sho. But you better take a rest when you git tired.”  I didn't stop. I piled on the material until he said, “That there's the scoop we been trying to find. That's what we want. You better stand back a little, 'cause I'm fixing to start her up.”  I backed away, watching him go over and push a switch. Shuddering into motion, the machine gave a sudden scream like a circular saw, and sent a tattoo of sharp crystals against my face. I moved clumsily away, seeing Brockway grin like a dried prune. Then with the dying hum of the furiously whirling drums, I heard the grains sifting lazily in the sudden stillness, sliding sand-like down the chute into the pot underneath.  I watched him go over and open a valve. A sharp new smell of oil arose.  “Now she's all set to cook down; all we got to do is put the fire to her,” he said, pressing a button on something that looked like the burner of an oil furnace. There was an angry hum, followed by a slight explosion that caused something to rattle, and I could hear a low roaring begin.  “Know what that's going to be when it's cooked?”  “No, sir,” I said. 	2.0	5	[1, 0, 2, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator is watching Brockway operate a machine that sifts and cooks something.  2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but the machine is described as shuddering into motion and then dying down, which suggests that the process takes at least a few minutes. Let's say five minutes.  3: Five minutes have elapsed.  4: 5 minutes.  5: High confidence.
57	ElliRI.txt|334|u	 “Hon, Hon,” he said, placing his hand on her shoulder. “It's the agent, not these gentlemen. He's the one. He says it's in the bank, but you know he's the one. We've done business with him for over twenty years.”  “Don't tell me,” she said. “It's all the white folks, not just one. They all against us. Every stinking low-down one of them.”  “She's right!” a hoarse voice said. “She's right! They all is!”  Something had been working fiercely inside me, and for a moment I had forgotten the rest of the crowd. Now I recognized a self-consciousness about them, as though they, we, were ashamed to witness the eviction, as though we were all unwilling intruders upon some shameful event; and thus we were careful not to touch or stare too hard at the effects that lined the curb; for we were witnesses of what we did not wish to see, though curious, fascinated, despite our shame, and through it all the old female, mind-plunging crying.  I looked at the old people, feeling my eyes burn, my throat tighten. The old woman's sobbing was having a strange effect upon me—as when a child, seeing the tears of its parents, is moved by both fear and sympathy to cry. I turned away, feeling myself being drawn to the old couple by a warm, dark, rising whirlpool of emotion which I feared. I was wary of what the sight of them crying there on the sidewalk was making me begin to feel. I wanted to leave, but was too ashamed to leave, was rapidly becoming too much a part of it to leave. 	0.7497	2	[3, 1, 0, 2]	VALID	1: A crowd watches an eviction. One man recognizes the agent as the cause of the eviction, and a woman blames all white people. The narrator feels a growing sense of shame and emotion as he watches the old couple being evicted. 2: The passage describes a moment of observation and reflection, so it's hard to say how much time has passed. Let's say it's a minute or two. 3: 2 minutes have elapsed. 4: 2 minutes. 5: High confidence.
58	ElliRI.txt|375|u	 “How about a drink for us, Emma?” Brother Jack said.  “Well, now, I'll have to think about it,” she said, tilting her severely drawn head and smiling.  “Don't think, act,” he said. “We're very thirsty men. This young man pushed history ahead twenty years today.”  “Oh,” she said, her eyes becoming intent. “You must tell me about him.”  “Just read the morning papers, Emma. Things have begun to move. Yes, leap ahead.” He laughed deeply.  “What would you like, Brother?” she said, her eyes brushing slowly over my face.  “Bourbon,” I said, a little too loudly, as I remembered the best the South had to offer. My face was warm, but I returned her glance as steadily as I dared. It was not the harsh uninterested-in-you-as-a-human-being stare that I'd known in the South, the kind that swept over a black man as though he were a horse or an insect; it was something more, a direct, what-type-of-mere-man-have-we-here kind of look that seemed to go beneath my skin … Somewhere in my leg a muscle twitched violently.  “Emma, the bourbon! Two bourbons,” Brother Jack said. 	1.2	3	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: Brother Jack and the narrator are at a bar with a woman named Emma. Brother Jack asks for a drink, and Emma asks about the narrator. The narrator orders bourbon, and Emma looks at him intently. Brother Jack orders two bourbons. 2: The events described in the passage would have taken a few minutes at most. The characters are in a bar, and the dialogue is brief.  3: Let's say three minutes have elapsed. 4: 3 minutes. 5: High confidence.
59	ElliRI.txt|499|u	 “Brothers, please,” Brother Jack said. “One at a time. What do you know about this article?” he said to me.  “Not very much,” I said. “The editor of the magazine called to say he was sending a reporter up for an interview. The reporter asked a few questions and took a few pictures with a little camera. That's all I know.”  “Did you give the reporter a prepared handout?”  “I gave her nothing except a few pieces of our official literature. I told her neither what to ask me nor what to write. I naturally tried to co-operate. If an article about me would help make friends for the movement I felt it was my duty.”  “Brothers, this thing was arranged,” Wrestrum said. “I tell you this opportunist had that reporter sent up there. He had her sent up and he told her what to write.”  “That's a contemptible lie,” I said. “You were present and you know I tried to get them to interview Brother Clifton!”  “Who's a lie?”  “You're a liar and a fat-mouthed scoundrel. You're a liar and no brother of mine.”  “Now he's calling me names. Brothers, you heard him.”  “Let's not lose our tempers,” Brother Jack said calmly. “Brother Wrestrum, you've made serious charges. Can you prove them?”  “I can prove them. All you have to do is read the magazine and prove them for yourself.”  “It will be read.	2.0	15	[3, 0, 2, 1]	VALID	1: A group of men are discussing an article about one of them. One man accuses the subject of arranging the article himself, and the subject denies it.  2: The events described in the passage are a conversation and argument. This could take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or more, depending on how long the conversation goes on. Let's say 15 minutes.  3: 15 minutes have elapsed. 4: 15 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
60	ElliRI.txt|519|u	 If they don't call by four o'clock, I'm saved, I told myself. But still no sign, not even a call to a meeting. Finally I rang her number, hearing her voice, delighted, gay and discreet; but no mention of the night or the man. And hearing her so composed and gay I was too embarrassed to bring it up. Perhaps this was the sophisticated and civilized way? Perhaps he was there and they had an understanding, a woman with full rights.  Would I return for further discussion, she wanted to know.  “Yes, of course,” I said.  “Oh, Brother,” she said.  I hung up with a mixture of relief and anxiety, unable to shrug off the notion that I had been tested and had failed. I went through the next week puzzling over it, and even more confused because I knew nothing definite of where I stood. I tried to detect any changes in my relations with Brother Jack and the others, but they gave no sign. And even if they had, I wouldn't have known its definite meaning, for it might have had to do with the charges. I was caught between guilt and innocence, so that now they seemed one and the same. My nerves were in a state of constant tension, my face took on a stiff, noncommittal expression, beginning to look like Brother Jack's and the other leaders'. Then I relaxed a bit; work had to be done and I would play the waiting game.	10080.0	10080	[1, 0, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator waits for a call from someone, but doesn't receive it. They call the person instead, but the person doesn't mention the night before. The narrator is confused and anxious about what this means for their relationship with the person and with their group.  2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but it does describe a week passing. The narrator also goes through a range of emotions and thoughts, which would take some time. Let's say a week has passed.  3: One week has elapsed. At seven days a week that's 7 days. 24 hours in a day, so 168 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 10080 minutes. 4: 10080 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
61	ElliRI.txt|528|u	 Barrelhouse had prepared me for the darkened windows of the district, but not, when I let myself in, to call in vain through the dark to Brother Tarp. I went to the room where he slept, but he was not there; then I went through the dark hall to my old office and threw myself into my desk chair, exhausted. Everything seemed to be slipping away from me and I could find no quick absorbing action that would get it under control. I tried to think of whom among the district committee I might call for information concerning Clifton, but here again I was balked. For if I selected one who believed that I had requested to be transferred because I hated my own people it would only complicate matters. No doubt there would be some who'd resent my return, so it was best to confront them all at once without giving any one of them the opportunity to organize any sentiment against me. It was best that I talk with Brother Tarp, whom I trusted. When he came in he could give me an idea of the state of affairs, and perhaps tell me what had actually happened to Clifton. 	7.0	12.5	[1, 0, 2, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator returns to the district and finds Brother Tarp missing. He reflects on his situation and decides to talk to Brother Tarp when he returns. 2: The events described in the passage, including the narrator's search for Brother Tarp and his reflections on his situation, would have taken at least 10-15 minutes. 3: 12.5 minutes have elapsed. 4: 12.5 minutes. 5: High confidence.
62	ElliRI.txt|547|u	Men out of time, who would soon be gone and forgotten … But who knew (and now I began to tremble so violently I had to lean against a refuse can)—who knew but that they were the saviors, the true leaders, the bearers of something precious? The stewards of something uncomfortable, burdensome, which they hated because, living outside the realm of history, there was no one to applaud their value and they themselves failed to understand it. What if Brother Jack were wrong? What if history was a gambler, instead of a force in a laboratory experiment, and the boys his ace in the hole? What if history was not a reasonable citizen, but a madman full of paranoid guile and these boys his agents, his big surprise! His own revenge? For they were outside, in the dark with Sambo, the dancing paper doll; taking it on the lambo with my fallen brother, Tod Clifton (Tod, Tod) running and dodging the forces of history instead of making a dominating stand.  A train came. I followed them inside. There were many seats and the three sat together. I stood, holding onto the center pole, looking down the length of the car. On one side I saw a white nun in black telling her beads, and standing before the door across the aisle there was another dressed completely in white, the exact duplicate of the other except that she was black and her black feet bare. Neither of the nuns was looking at the other but at their crucifixes, and suddenly I laughed and a verse I'd heard long ago at the Golden Day paraphrased itself in my mind:  Bread and Wine,  Bread and Wine,  Your cross ain't nearly so  Heavy as mine …    And the nuns rode on with lowered heads. 	9.0	10	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator reflects on the possibility that the black men he has been working with might be the true leaders and saviors of society. He follows them onto a train and sees two nuns, one black and one white, who are not looking at each other but at their crucifixes.  2: The narrator's reflections and observations might take a few minutes. The train ride is not described in detail, but it is probably at least a few minutes long.  3: Let's say the whole scene takes 10 minutes.  4: 10 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
63	ElliRI.txt|721|u	 In going underground, I whipped it all except the mind, the mind. And the mind that has conceived a plan of living must never lose sight of the chaos against which that pattern was conceived. That goes for societies as well as for individuals. Thus, having tried to give pattern to the chaos which lives within the pattern of your certainties, I must come out, I must emerge. And there's still a conflict within me: With Louis Armstrong one half of me says, “Open the window and let the foul air out,” while the other says, “It was good green corn before the harvest.” Of course Louis was kidding, he wouldn't have thrown old Bad Air out, because it would have broken up the music and the dance, when it was the good music that came from the bell of old Bad Air's horn that counted. Old Bad Air is still around with his music and his dancing and his diversity, and I'll be up and around with mine. And, as I said before, a decision has been made. I'm shaking off the old skin and I'll leave it here in the hole. I'm coming out, no less invisible without it, but coming out nevertheless. And I suppose it's damn well time. Even hibernations can be overdone, come to think of it. Perhaps that's my greatest social crime, I've overstayed my hibernation, since there's a possibility that even an invisible man has a socially responsible role to play. 	2628000.0	43200	[0, 2, 1, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator reflects on the need to emerge from hiding and take a socially responsible role.  2: The passage is entirely reflective and does not describe any events that would take time. However, the narrator does mention hibernation, which implies a period of inactivity. Let's say the narrator has been in a state of hibernation for a month.  3: One month has elapsed. At 30 days a month that's 720 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 43200 minutes. 4: 43200 minutes. 5: High confidence.

He only wanted us to listen to him rave!” But only partially true: Being invisible and without substance, a disembodied voice, as it were, what else could I do? What else but try to tell you what was really happening when your eyes were looking through? And it is this which frightens me:  Who knows but that, on the lower frequencies, I speak for you? 	0	5	[1, 3, 2, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator reflects on the nature of his invisibility and the purpose of his storytelling.  2: The passage is entirely reflective and does not describe any events that would take time.

65	SwarGT.txt|0|u	1   REQUIESCAT   WICKENBURG — Mrs. Jeanette Champie, 93, Arizona pioneer, died Tuesday in Phoenix. Born in Comfort, Texas, Mrs. Champie moved to Arizona in 1888 with her husband, the late A.F. Champie, with whom she celebrated their 62nd wedding anniversary in 1945. Mr. Champie was a mining man and the couple resided in several Yavapai County mining towns until they moved to Wickenburg. Mrs. Champie's early days in the Arizona Territory were laced with harrowing experiences. She was often forced to cope with raiding Indians. Once she shot a mountain lion out of a tree directly above her while her young children gathered about her in terror.      2   WHEN   This nation's history is the richer because a few of our forefathers had the gumption and literacy to put down on paper a day-to-day chronicle of their adventures as they bustled our frontier westward. Such accounts are invaluable. They spank life and breath into the past. We treasure them in family Bibles, in library collections of Americana, and in print. But there has taken place in the last twenty years the most incredible mass traipse from East to West that any country has ever known. It is The Great American Sashay. From Grand Forks to Norfolk, from Skowhegan to Shreveport, hordes of New Pioneers have hit the trail in search of whatever they have lost, or what they never found. U-Drive-It trains of superhighway settlers have peopled The Fancy Dress Frontier of the 1950's and 1960's. Who will record for the future their vicissitudes and victories? Who will tell this chromium-plated Eastern Western story? 	10512000.0	48880800	[1, 2, 0, 3]	VALID	1: An obituary for Mrs. Jeanette Champie, an Arizona pioneer who died at age 93. The obituary describes her move to Arizona in 1888 with her husband, a mining man, and their life in several mining towns before settling in Wickenburg. It also mentions her experiences with raiding Indians and shooting a mountain lion.  2: The first paragraph of the passage describes events that took place over the course of Mrs. Champie's life, from her birth in Comfort, Texas to her death in Phoenix. The second paragraph is a reflection on the importance of documenting the experiences of modern-day pioneers who have moved westward in the last 20 years. It doesn't describe any specific events or time frame.  3: The first paragraph spans 93 years, from Mrs. Champie's birth to her death. At 365 days a year, that's 33,945 days x 24 hours in a day, so 814,680 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 48,880,800 minutes. The second paragraph doesn't describe any specific events or time frame, so we can't estimate any time for it.  4: 48,880,800 minutes.  5: High confidence for the first paragraph, but low confidence for the second paragraph due to lack of information.
66	SwarGT.txt|1|u	 I nominate myself, H. Carleton Cadell, husband and father, yokel and intellectual, late of Old Wycherley, Connecticut, and better late than ever.  Call me a Cadillac cowboy if you will. The Grand Central Station Gang, my former fellow-riders on the New York, New Haven & Hartford stage line, insult me, so I hear, with labels similarly choice. “Billy the Button-Down Kid,” they scoff, or “The T.S. Eliot Tenderfoot” or “Wyatt Earp with an Attache Case.”  Let them have their jest. Archetype of the dude I may be, but I have gone west now, where men are men and where, when you say such things, stranger, you smile.  It was books, not a six-gun, which sent me packing, which made of me a dilettante Don Quixote gone daft from reading. For some time after marriage I pretended industry by commuting now and then from our estate to New York, to the Public Library, and there for several hours doing research for a possible Ph.D. in history. By chance I crossed a Mississippi of the mind and commenced to graze with rising appetite in a territory of Indians and ranchers and cavalry and gunflghters and romance from whence I was never emotionally to return. As a historian I had found my era, as a man my place. Stooped, spindle-shanked, thick-lensed, balding pedant—not I! In this bony breast there snorted a bison, there swaggered a roistering mountain man, there was born, a civilization too late, a stripling Teddy Roosevelt hot for deeds of derring-do! 	1576800.0	129600	[3, 1, 0, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator introduces himself as H. Carleton Cadell, a man who has moved from Connecticut to the West. He explains that he was once a bookish man, but has now found his place in the West. 2: The passage describes a change in the narrator's life, from being a bookish man to being a man of action. This change probably took some time to happen, but it's difficult to say how long. Let's say it took a few months. 3: Let's say three months have elapsed. At 30 days a month that's 90 days. 24 hours in a day, so 2160 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 129600 minutes. 4: 129600 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the estimate is based on a guess about how long it would take for a change in personality to occur.

I had come, in a sense, three thousand miles to meet, to accredit, indeed to bard this man! The second day, therefore, after the heavy hors d'oeuvres party and the rescue of the deer, I hit the trail on foot across several acres of desert and up to Fast Draw Drive, a new street on which, it gradually dawned on me, there was but one house, the scandal of Temptation Valley, the only one the Boyds could possibly have bought! Everyone called it the “Trader Vic” house, and in fact, with its rococo-Polynesian roof lines, its violent coral siding, its spear-and-grass ornamentation, its full-sized prau, or dugout canoe, hanging in the carport, it did resemble a restaurant rather than a residence. Perched vertiginously on a ledge of rock above two other homes and priced at $250,000, it had gone buyerless for over a year and been the subject of debate about whether or not anyone in possession of any faculties could ever be suckered into such an eyesore. Someone had been. A mailbox in the shape of a coconut named the victim as “E.B.

What I entered was a movie set, not a living room. The ceiling was thatched with palm fronds. 	2880.0	2700	[3, 1, 2, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator walks across a desert and up to a house, which he describes in detail.  2: Walking across a desert would take at least an hour, but the passage doesn't describe the length of the walk. The narrator also spends some time looking at the house and describing it. Let's say 30 minutes to an hour.  3: 45 minutes have elapsed. Multiplying by 60 minutes an hour that's 2700 minutes. 4: 2700 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because of the ambiguity about the length of the walk.

It's so we'd have us a place t' go an' t' meet folks an' have frien's. It's so we'd b'long t' somethin' in town. Please, Carleton?”  Suddenly a breeze cleared the smoke from his burnished, youthful countenance. I looked into eyes as trusting and supplicant as a captive deer's. For once in my life I met innocence cornea to cornea. The word has been debased. I mean innocence such as we associate with rosebuds, with babes in mangers, with graves and Grecian urns, with harps on high, with the most distant dewy dawnings of the earth. I mean innocence of such depth and rarity and truth that my heart literally turned within me, recoiled in shame that I had dared even for a moment to doubt its presence.  “Yes, Eddie Bud, I'll get you in the club, I'll help you, I'll do everything!” I said, the words springing from my mouth like frogs. “You didn't even have to ask!”  “Ah do thank you, Carleton. How come?”  “Because you're the genuine, indubitable article,” I said. “Because in you the past still lives. Because in you I find all those qualities which have made the American character unique—daring, innocence, democracy, gusto, humor, cussedness, generosity, industry, vision, independence, horse sense, ingenuity, grit, sociability.” I swallowed the lump in my throat. 	1.0	5	[0, 2, 3, 1]	VALID	1: A man named Carleton is talking to someone named Eddie Bud, who wants to join a club. Carleton initially refuses, but then changes his mind after being moved by Eddie Bud's innocence.  2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage. However, the events described involve a conversation, a moment of reflection, and a change of heart. These things take time, even if only a few minutes. Let's say the conversation and reflection took five minutes.  3: Five minutes have elapsed. 4: 5 minutes. 5: High confidence.

So overwhelmed was I by admiration and love for the man, by sheer natal joy in him, by recognitions and revelations which had come too swiftly, that I rushed from the room, undergoing as I left the house the raven gaze of his small, mustachioed retainer. “Adios, Titano!” I cried. Answer came there none.      7   REQUIESCAT    CEDAR CREEK—In a simple tribal service, R-25, believed to be the last of the numbered Apaches, was buried here yesterday on the reservation where he lived for seventy-six years. His real name was Oga Altaha, but he was given the R-25 designation by Gen. George Crook many years ago when the old U.S. Cavalry identified the Apaches by serial numbers. Under clear skies and in a biting wind R-25 was carried to the cemetery in a plain pickup truck. Following tribal custom, the casket was buried facing east so he may always greet the rising sun. The Apaches believe strongly in immortality, so food, clothing, and a small jug of water were placed in Oga Altaha's grave to insure comfort on the long journey to the hereafter.      8   HOW    Married money is best. About inherited wealth one must be modest, while that earned has invariably a sweaty odor; but riches gained by marriage are like manna fallen from Heaven. Devour them, I say, and damn the stomach acids. 	1.0	7	[3, 2, 1, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator and another man become partners, and the narrator is overwhelmed with admiration and love for him. The narrator leaves the room and encounters a mustachioed retainer. The scene then shifts to a news article about the burial of an Apache man, and then to a brief reflection on the benefits of marrying for money. 2: The events in the first paragraph are brief and could take only a few minutes. The news article and reflection are not described in terms of time, but we can guess that reading and reflecting on them would take at least five minutes.  3: Let's say 7 minutes have elapsed.  4: 7 minutes. 5: High confidence.

It is either in the middle of one or on the top of the other that the vision comes or the test is met.” Conceive my dismay, then, this morning when, my feet on the desk, in a posture and state conducive to vision, the furniture, the very walls of the house commenced to vibrate, and there lunked into sight through my window an immense bulldozer. It rooted and snorted, raping, obviously, of the immaculate desert, a new street. I left the house and striding across the terrain shouted at the operator to cease and desist at once. He could not hear. Just as I snatched up a chunk of quartz to hurl at him, a jeep, following the machine, pulled up, and the driver introduced himself as Walt Duppa, the developer, he was proud to state, of Sarcophagus Shadows. He unrolled a plat. Sarcophagus Shadows was the eighty acres around us, running clear to the mountaintop; he had just bought it, he proposed to grade and pave streets, bring in utilities, and to get thirty building sites out of it. Progress, he said.  He wore a Foreign Legion kepi. Sternly I inquired if he needed the money? 	7.0	2700	[1, 2, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator is sitting with their feet on a desk, in a state conducive to vision, when a bulldozer appears outside their window. The narrator goes outside and meets a developer who has just bought the land around them and plans to build on it. 2: The narrator is already in a state conducive to vision, so it's possible that they've been sitting there for a while. The bulldozer is already at work when the narrator sees it, so it's possible that it's been there for a while too. The narrator goes outside and has a conversation with the developer, which takes some time. Let's say the narrator has been sitting for 30 minutes to an hour, and the conversation with the developer takes another 30 minutes to an hour.  3: Let's say 45 minutes have elapsed.

You ain't picked up thet check by the time we're gone, it's your funeral.”  “Funeral?”  At the word's implication the showroom went deathly still. The very air seemed to crackle with conflict. Two employees, a secretary and a mechanic, scurried out of range.  “Boyd,” the dealer said slowly, “theah's some things a man'll do an' some he won't.”  “Huckabee,” replied the cattleman softly, “he wants t' stay in business he will.”  The situation was irreversibly reversed. Amicable strangers only moments ago, buyer and seller were now combatants in a stylized, commercial showdown. They backed off from one another. Each seemed to assume his own version of the classic stance, the dealer slightly crouched, arms loose, right hand just below hip lever, the cattleman more erect, his budding belly flattened.  “You pushin' me, Boyd.”  “Make your play, Huckabee.”  Under the wide hat brims, level, lethal stare met level lethal stare. Which would falter first, which would first betray? I edged behind the sedan. The drama was breathtaking, heroical, in the most genetic American tradition!  Suddenly, with a superb indifference, Boyd deliberately turned his back and strode out the door!  I hurried after him.  Wordless, we settled ourselves in the Buick. 	2.5	15	[3, 1, 0, 2]	VALID	1: A cattleman and a car dealer negotiate the sale of a car. The cattleman writes a check for $10,000, and threatens the dealer with violence if he doesn't cash it before the cattleman leaves. The dealer and the cattleman then face off in a tense confrontation, but the dealer ultimately backs down and the cattleman leaves.  2: The negotiation and confrontation take some time, but it's hard to say how much.

The entire transaction had been completed in ten minutes.  I was not too sapped by tension to applaud. “Eddie Bud, you were simply great!”  “Like takin' candy from a baby.”  “No! It was a real coup de Cadillac!” But as we waited to take delivery of the automobiles, arithmetic triumphed over my emotion. “Ten thousand dollars,” I mused, “just like that.”  “Damn good deal. Carleton, if a thing's bought right, it's half sold.”  I was not reassured. To the $10,000 I added the $6000 for Titano's searchlight and the $150,000 for the Trader Vic monstrosity, which had yet to be furnished, plus the $14,000 for the pool and the $1000 for saddles. The total, for a few weeks, was appalling. He had indeed come to town, and I had authenticated him, but apparently my functions, while chiefly tutorial, must also include those of spiritual guardian.

The narrator reflects on the cost of the cars and other expenses. 2: The transaction itself takes ten minutes, but the narrator also reflects on the cost of the cars and other expenses.

Fortunately I was not present, nor would I have been morbid enough to question him, but his attorneys have provided me with a few of the details.  Recall that his home clings to the side of Sarcophagus Mountain. Situated in direct vertical line on the slope below are two other mansions owned, one would have assumed, by affluent and forgiving neighbors. These let us designate Houses #1 and #2. Recall, too, that on the verge of physical and nervous collapse I had staggered to my own domicile. What then ensued we may reconstruct as follows.  Forth he led the trembling Christabel, enthroning her behind the wheel of the convertible. In excess of pride he ordered her to take it around the block. She could not even start it. This he did for her, and showed her how to shift into drive. To the accelerator she put bare foot. In her behalf, let it be entered here that the unworldly girl had never before driven a vehicle more sophisticated than a pickup truck. Faced with automatic shift, power brakes, power steering, power windows, power seat, power top, and an array of other controls as intricate as those for guidance in space, she was helpless. Evidently she pulled and pushed everything. Perhaps it was the wrong bit for the beast, perhaps a burr under its saddle. “Whoa!” she screamed. But this was a steed foaled in Detroit, not in Colorado's high country. The Cadillac bucked forward, then flinging gravel leaped across their acreage to a rendezvous with the law of gravity. 	15.0	240	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: A cattleman gives his bride a new car, but she doesn't know how to drive it. She tries to drive it around the block, but crashes it instead. 2: The passage doesn't give any explicit reference to time, but it does describe a series of events that would take some time to unfold. Let's say that the cattleman gives his bride the car in the morning, and that the crash happens later that day. That would be a few hours at most. 3: Let's say four hours have elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour, that's 240 minutes. 4: 240 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

During my absence on the circuit, Dorene and Suzanne began riding lessons from a wrangler at a nearby resort, whose honorarium is $10 per hour. They also joined, bless their girlish hearts, a riding club located ten miles away, and this necessitated the purchase of a two-horse van, which in turn required a custom hitch for the rear bumper of the Bentley, which was scarcely designed for the hauling of horses. Thinking to ensalad the cuisine of their pets, moreover, the girls the other day fed them day-old clippings from the lawn piled up by our yard man. These had fermented.

The veterinarian is called every hour on the hour. The passage then shifts to the narrator's frustration with a nearby real estate development that is disrupting the local wildlife. 2: The events with the horses and the veterinarian are ongoing, but it's unclear how long they have been happening. The real estate development has been going on for weeks. Let's say the horse-related events have been happening for a day or two.  3: Let's say two days have elapsed.

Time ah went t' Denver.” “At a movie picture?” “No. Theah was a fire.”  The lobby filled. The elite of Phoenix hung from the decor. An orchestra struck up and out. The lights dimmed, leaving only the runway in glare. To applause, the internationally renowned couturier to the internationally renowned, notorious Pierre Mannique, made an entrance to commentate his new collection, jetted out only that afternoon from his Fifth Avenue boutique.  Pierre informed us that alors, mesdames et messieurs, zis was ze year of ze “Bonbon Look.” To begin, he would illustrate with hats. The first model slithered down the runway with a bonbon of velvet crushed into her coif, to be followed by bonbons of silk, leather, and fur. Then came frocks, coats, ball gowns. Mannique was the real bonbon. A flit of the flittiest sort, his giggles were shrill, his hands darty as bats, and his accent seemed to me to have in it a soupcon of St. Paul-Minneapolis in addition to the Faubourg St.-Honore. Reba was interested. The Boyds were riveted. Neither of them had ever dreamed the sex might be so lavishly titivated. With side glances at his wife's second-hand apparel, Eddie Bud dealt rapidly from his stack of scrip.	10.0	1200	[1, 2, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The passage describes a fashion show, with a designer named Pierre Mannique showing off his new collection.

Ciao, chaps.”  Our flight back across the haunted, patient reservation was like that of two thugs with their loot. “We hit us the jackpot, partner! They're baled up like cotton, them rugs, but what ah could see, they're pretty as money in the bank!”  Eddie Bud said once, but did not speak again until we junctioned with U.S. 66 on the outskirts of Flagstaff, where he pulled off onto the concrete apron by an all-night gasoline station. It was light here, he said, and there was something he wanted to see. First he'd borrow some wire cutters from the attendant. I waited in the pickup. It was midnight. Cars horneted past monotonously on U.S. 66, families sleeping inside, worldly goods jammed into trailers, all heading west, to California I hoped. Above me, north of Flagstaff, twelve-thousand-foot peaks ruminated. It was depressing to reflect that most of the beautiful, wooded acreage on their slopes belong not to the nation but to syndicates of movie stars. The commission man returned with a tool and climbed into the bed of the pickup.  There was sound and movement, then nothing. After several minutes I got out. Eddie Bud sat slumped.

In the good old days Apache braves were wont to snick off the tips of their wives' noses at the slightest provocation, even infidelity.”  But she was not to be humored out of it. She marched to the laundry room, there to bandage and console a bruised Annie, even to do the ironing in her stead. John Hochee, out of work and temperish, last night it seems laid hands on some firewater and then on the feckless Annie, beating, to be blunt, the be-Jesus out of her.  I did not like the retributive glint in Reba's eye. “Bride of my autumn, buddy of my bed,” said I, “you have done all that anyone may do for the sake of the Original American. Leave well enough alone. In short, dear wife, mind henceforth your own business.”      48   DILEMMA    How felicitous was early Arizona's choice of the cactus wren as state bird. Strutty, with a raucous song, its single ornithological function seems to be to despoil the landscape with beak and bowel. 	2.0	10	[3, 0, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator reflects on President Taft's opposition to capital punishment, then describes a conversation with his wife Reba about a woman named Annie who was beaten by a man named John Hochee. The narrator tries to dissuade Reba from seeking revenge. The narrator then reflects on the cactus wren as Arizona's state bird. 2: The passage includes some reflection and conversation, but also describes a specific event: John Hochee's attack on Annie. It's unclear how long ago this happened, but it seems to be recent. Let's say it happened the night before. The conversation and reflection might take a few minutes.  3: Let's say 10 minutes have elapsed.  4: 10 minutes. 5: High confidence.

How had he known?  “Oh God, Titano, oh God!” I shouted. “What have I done? What have I done?”  There was only the generator's roaring malediction. I fought for grace, for forgiveness.  “Titano,” I cried, “if your cross is not knowing where to begin, I understand, I sympathize! Begin anywhere! But speak! Only a word!

MEASURE FOR MEASURE.  SCARCELY had the abbey-bell tolled for five minutes, and already was the church of the Capuchins thronged with auditors. Do not encourage the idea, that the crowd was assembled either from motives of piety or thirst of information. But very few were influenced by those reasons; and in a city where superstition reigns with  such despotic sway as in Madrid, to seek for true devotion would be a fruitless attempt. The audience now assembled in the Capuchin church was collected by various causes, but all of them were foreign to the ostensible motive. The women came to show themselves, the men to see the women: some were attracted by curiosity to hear an orator so celebrated; some came, because they had no better means of employing their time till the play began; some, from being assured that it would be impossible to find places in the church; and one half of Madrid was brought thither by expecting to meet the other half. The only persons truly anxious to hear the preacher, were a few antiquated devotees, and half a dozen rival orators, determined to find fault with and ridicule the discourse. As to the remainder of the audience, the sermon might have been omitted altogether, certainly without their being disappointed, and very probably without their perceiving the omission. 	5.0	12.5	[2, 1, 0, 3]	VALID	1: The passage describes a crowd assembling in a church in Madrid to hear a sermon, but few are there for religious reasons.  2: The passage doesn't give a clear indication of how long it took for the crowd to assemble, but it does say that the abbey-bell had only tolled for five minutes.

82	LewiMMR.txt|1|u	Whatever was the occasion, it is at least certain, that the Capuchin church had never witnessed a more numerous assembly. Every corner was filled, every seat was occupied. The very statues which ornamented the long aisles were pressed into the service. Boys suspended themselves upon the wings of cherubims; St. Francis and St. Mark bore each a spectator on his shoulders; and St. Agatha found herself under the necessity of carrying double. The consequence was, that, in spite of all their hurry and expedition, our two newcomers, on entering the church, looked round in vain for places. However, the old woman continued to move forwards. In vain were exclamations of displeasure vented against her from all sides: in vain was she addressed with 'I assure you, Segnora, there are no places here,' 'I beg, Segnora, that you will not crowd me so intolerably!' 'Segnora, you cannot pass this way. Bless me! How can people be so troublesome!'  The old woman was obstinate, and on she went. By dint of perseverance and two brawny arms she made a passage through the crowd, and managed to bustle herself into the very body of the church, at no great distance from the pulpit. Her companion had followed her with timidity and in silence, profiting by the exertions of her conductress. 'Holy Virgin!' exclaimed the old woman in a tone of disappointment, while she threw a glance of enquiry round her; 'Holy Virgin! what heat! what a crowd! I wonder what can be the meaning of all this. I believe we must return: there is no such thing as a seat to be had, and nobody seems kind enough to accommodate us with theirs.' 	4.0	12.5	[1, 0, 2, 3]	VALID	1: An old woman and her companion enter a crowded church and struggle to find a seat.  2: The events described in the passage, including the old woman's struggle to make her way through the crowd, would have taken at least 10-15 minutes.  3: Let's say 12.5 minutes.  4: 12.5 minutes.  5: High confidence.
83	LewiMMR.txt|103|u	 THE marquis and Lorenzo proceeded to the hotel in silence. The former employed himself in calling every circumstance to his mind, which related might give Lorenzo's the most favourable idea of his connexion with Agnes. The latter, justly alarmed for the honour of his family, felt embarrassed by the presence of the marquis: the adventure which he had just witnessed forbad his treating him as a friend; and Antonia's interests being entrusted to his mediation, he saw the impolicy of treating him as a foe. He concluded from these  reflections, that profound silence would be the wisest plan, and waited with impatience for Don Raymond's explanation. They arrived at the hotel de las Cisternas. The marquis immediately conducted him to his apartment, and began to express his satisfaction at finding him at Madrid. Lorenzo interrupted him. 'Excuse me, my lord,' said he with a distant air, 'if I reply somewhat coldly to your expressions of regard. A sister's honour is involved in this affair: till that is established, and the purport of your correspondence with Agnes cleared up, I cannot consider you as my friend. I am anxious to hear the meaning of your conduct; and hope that you will not delay the promised explanation.' 'First give me your word, that you will listen with patience and indulgence.' 'I love my sister too well to judge her harshly; and, till this moment, I possessed no friend so dear to me as yourself. I will also confess, that your having it in your power  to oblige me in a business which I have much at heart, makes me very anxious to find you still deserving my esteem.' 	25.0	60	[0, 3, 1, 2]	VALID	1: The Marquis and Lorenzo go to a hotel in Madrid. The Marquis wants to explain his relationship with Agnes, but Lorenzo is wary and wants to hear an explanation of the Marquis's conduct first. 2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the characters have time to reflect on their situation and have traveled to a hotel. This probably took at least an hour.  3: One hour has elapsed. 4: 60 minutes. 5: High confidence.
84	LewiMMR.txt|111|u	Luckily, as I then thought, an opportunity presented itself of passing the night more agreeably than I expected. On mentioning my design of proceeding by myself to Strasbourg, the postillion shook his head in disapprobation. 'It is a long way,' said he; 'you will find it a difficult matter to arrive there without a guide: besides, monsieur seems unaccustomed to the season's severity; and 'tis possible that, unable to sustain the excessive cold ' 'What use is there to present me with all these objections?' said I, impatiently interrupting him: 'I have no other resource; I run still greater risk of perishing with cold by passing the night in the forest.' 'Passing the night in the forest?' he replied. 'Oh, by St. Denis! we are not in quite so bad a plight as that comes to yet. If I am not mistaken, we are scarcely five minutes walk from the cottage of my old friend  Baptiste: he is a wood-cutter, and a very honest fellow. I doubt not but he will shelter you for the night with pleasure. In the mean time, I can take the saddle-horse, ride to Strasbourg, and be back with proper people to mend your carriage by break of day.' 'And, in the name of God,' said I, 'how could you leave me so long in suspense? Why did you not tell me of this cottage sooner? What excessive stupidity!' 'I thought, that perhaps monsieur would not deign to accept ' 	5.0	10	[1, 2, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator is traveling to Strasbourg and is worried about the cold. The postillion suggests they stay at a friend's cottage nearby. The narrator is annoyed that the postillion didn't mention the cottage earlier. 2: The events described in the passage are a conversation between the narrator and the postillion. This conversation probably took around 10 minutes. 3: 10 minutes. 4: 10 minutes. 5: High confidence.
85	LewiMMR.txt|147|u	 He rose in spite of his malady, and dressed himself with all speed. I fastened one of the sheets round his arms, and lowered him from the window. He flew to the stable, took Claude's horse, and hastened to Strasbourg. Had he been accosted by the banditti, he was to have declared himself sent upon a message by Baptiste, but fortunately he reached the town without meeting any obstacle. Immediately upon his arrival at Strasbourg, he entreated assistance from the magistrate: his story passed from mouth to mouth, and at length came to the knowledge of my lord the baron. Anxious for the safety of his lady, who he knew would be upon the road that evening, it struck him that she might have fallen into the power of the robbers. He accompanied Theodore, who guided the soldiers towards the cottage, and arrived just in time to save us from falling once more into the hands of our enemies.' Here I interrupted Marguerite to enquire why the sleepy potion had been presented to me. She said, that Baptiste supposed me to have arms about me, and  wished to incapacitate me from making resistance: it was a precaution which he always took, since, as the travellers had no hopes of escaping, despair would have incited them to sell their lives dearly. The baron then desired Marguerite to inform him what were her present plans. I joined him in declaring my readiness to shew my gratitude to her for the preservation of my life. 	6.0	1530	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: A man rises despite being ill, dresses quickly, and is lowered out of a window by a sheet. He takes a horse and rides to Strasbourg, where he seeks help from the magistrate. The baron accompanies soldiers to the cottage where the man and others had been held captive, and they arrive just in time to save them. The narrator asks why she was given a sleepy potion, and Marguerite explains that it was a precaution against resistance. 2: The events described involve a lot of action, but there is no explicit reference to time. However, the man dresses himself 'with all speed,' which suggests that he was moving quickly. Let's say it took him 10 minutes to dress and be lowered out of the window. Riding to Strasbourg would have taken at least an hour, and seeking help from the magistrate and gathering soldiers would have taken at least another hour. Riding back to the cottage would have taken at least another hour. Marguerite's explanation of the sleepy potion suggests that the bandits had been holding them captive for some time before the man's escape, so let's say they had been captive for at least a day before the man's escape.  3: The range of possible times is 25 hours to 26 hours. The midpoint is 25.5 hours. Multiplying by 60 minutes in an hour gives 1530 minutes. 4: 1530 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
86	LewiMMR.txt|193|u	The singularity of my adventure made me determine to conceal it from every one, since I could not expect that a circumstance so strange should gain credit. I was very uneasy about Agnes. I knew not what she would think at not finding me at the rendezvous,  and dreaded her entertaining suspicions of my fidelity. However, I depended upon Theodore's discretion, and trusted that my letter to the baroness would convince her of the rectitude of my intentions. These considerations somewhat lightened my inquietude upon her account; but the impression left upon my mind by my nocturnal visitor, grew stronger with every succeeding moment. The night drew near; I dreaded its arrival; yet I strove to persuade myself that the ghost would appear no more, and at all events I desired that a servant might sit up in my chamber. The fatigue of my body, from not having slept on the former night, co-operating with the strong opiates administered to me in profusion, at length procured me that repose of which I was so much in need. I sunk into a profound and tranquil slumber, and had already slept for some hours, when the neighbouring clock roused me by striking 'one.' Its sound brought with it to my memory all the horrors of the night  before. The same cold shivering seized me. I started up in my bed, and perceived the servant fast asleep in an arm-chair near me. I called him by his name: he made no answer. I shook him forcibly by the arm, and strove in vain to wake him: he was perfectly insensible to my efforts. I now heard the heavy steps ascending the stair-case; the door was thrown open, and again the bleeding nun stood before me. Once more my limbs were chained in second infancy: once more I heard those fatal words repeated, Raymond! Raymond! Thou art mine! 	420.0	360	[0, 2, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator reflects on the singularity of a recent adventure and worries about Agnes's reaction to his absence. He is also haunted by a ghostly visitor from the previous night. He tries to persuade himself that the ghost will not return, but eventually falls asleep. He wakes up in the middle of the night to find his servant asleep and the ghostly visitor has returned. 2: The passage describes the narrator's thoughts and feelings, which take place over a period of time. The events of the previous night and the narrator's worries about Agnes would have taken at least a few hours. The narrator falls asleep and wakes up in the middle of the night, so at least a few more hours have passed. Let's say a total of 6 hours. 3: 6 hours have elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour, that's 360 minutes. 4: 360 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
87	LewiMMR.txt|211|u	'The domains of Lindenberg now fell to a distant relation. But terrified by the accounts given him of the bleeding nun [so  was the spectre called by the multitude] the new baron called to his assistance a celebrated exorciser. This holy man succeeded in obliging her to temporary repose: but though she discovered to him her history, he was not permitted to reveal it to others, or cause her skeleton to be removed to hallowed ground. That office was reserved for you; and till your coming her ghost was doomed to wander about the castle, and lament the crime which she had there committed. However, the exorciser obliged her to silence during his life-time. So long as he existed, the haunted chamber was shut up, and the spectre was invisible. At his death, which happened in five years after, she again appeared, but only once on every fifth year, on the same day and at the same hour when she plunged her knife in the heart of her sleeping lover: she then visited the cavern which held her mouldering skeleton, returned to the castle as soon as the clock struck two, and was seen no more till the next five years had elapsed. 'She was doomed to suffer during the space of a century. That period is past. Nothing now remains but to consign to the grave the ashes of Beatrice. I have been the means of releasing you from your visionary tormentor; and amidst all the sorrows which oppress me, to think that I have been of use to you, is some consolation. Youth, farewell! May the ghost of your relation enjoy that rest in the tomb, which the Almighty's vengeance has denied to me for ever!' 	2628000.0	2628000	[1, 3, 2, 0]	VALID	1: The passage describes the history of a haunted castle, and how an exorcist was able to temporarily put the ghost to rest. The ghost was only able to appear once every five years, and was doomed to suffer for a century. The speaker has been able to release the ghost from her torment.  2: The passage describes events that took place over a century, but the focus is on the ghost's appearances every five years. It's unclear how long the exorcist was able to keep the ghost at bay, but let's say he was able to do so for 10 years. This would mean that the ghost appeared twice during the time period described in the passage.  3: 10 years have elapsed, which is 3650 days x 24 hours in a day, so 87600 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 5256000 minutes. Divided by 2 (since the ghost appeared twice) gives 2628000 minutes. 4: 2628000 minutes. 5: Low confidence, since there is a lot of speculation involved in estimating the time period during which the exorcist was able to keep the ghost at bay.
88	LewiMMR.txt|226|u	She started from the bank on which she was seated. I endeavoured to detain her; but she disengaged herself from me with violence, and took refuge in the convent. I retired, filled with confusion and inquietude. The next morning I failed not, as usual, to appear in the garden; but Agnes was no where to be seen. At night I waited for her at the place where we generally met. I found no better success. Several days and nights passed away in the same manner. At  length I saw my offended mistress cross the walk, on whose borders I was working: she was accompanied by the same young pensioner, on whose arm she seemed, from weakness, obliged to support herself. She looked upon me for a moment, but instantly turned her head away. I waited her return; but she passed on to the convent without paying any attention to me, or the penitent looks with which I implored her forgiveness. As soon as the nuns were retired, the old gardener joined me with a sorrowful air. 'Segnor,' said he, 'it grieves me to say, that I can be no longer of use to you; the lady whom you used to meet has just assured me, that if I admitted you again into the garden, she would discover the whole business to the lady prioress. She bade me tell you also, that your presence was an insult, and that, if you still possess the least respect for her, you will never attempt to see her more. Excuse me then  for informing you, that I can favour your disguise no longer. Should the prioress be acquainted with my conduct, she might not be contented with dismissing me her service: out of revenge, she might accuse me of having profaned the convent, and cause me to be thrown into the prisons of the Inquisition.' 	7200.0	10080	[0, 3, 1, 2]	VALID	1: A man tries to apologize to a woman named Agnes, but she runs away from him and takes refuge in a convent. He tries to see her again for several days and nights, but she avoids him. Eventually, he sees her with another man, and she tells the gardener not to let him into the garden again. The gardener is afraid of being accused of profaning the convent and refuses to help the man anymore. 2: The passage describes several days and nights passing, but it's unclear how many. Let's say a week has passed. 3: One week has elapsed. At seven days a week that's 7 days. 24 hours in a day, so 168 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 10080 minutes. 4: 10080 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
89	LewiMMR.txt|237|u	  A feather now of golden hue He smiling from his pinion drew; This to the poet's hand the boy commits; And straight before Anacreaon's eyes The fairest dreams of fancy rise, And round his favoured head wild inspiration flits.   His bosom glows with amorous fire; Eager he grasps the magic lyre; Swift o'er the tuneful chords his fingers move: The feather plucked from Cupid's wing Sweeps the too-long neglected string, While soft Anacreon sings the power and praise of love.   Soon as that name was heard, the woods Shook off their snows; the melting floods Broke their cold chains, and winter fled away. Once more the earth was decked with flowers; Mild zephyrs breathed through blooming bowers; High towered the glorious sun, and poured then blaze of day.    Attracted by the harmonious sound, Sylvans and fauns the cot surround, And curious crowd the minstrel to behold: The wood-nymphs haste the spell to prove; Eager they run; they list, they love, And, while they hear the strain, forget the man is old.   Cupid, to nothing constant long, Perched on the harp attends the song, Or stifles with a kiss the dulcet notes: Now on the poet's breast reposes, Now twines his hoary locks with roses, Or borne on wings of gold in wanton circle floats.   Then thus Anacreon 'I no more At other shrines my vows will pour, Since Cupid deigns my numbers to inspire: From Phoebus or the blue-eyed maid Now shall my verse request no aid, For Love alone shall be the patron of my lyre. 	0	60	[0, 2, 3, 1]	VALID	1: Anacreon, a poet, is given a feather by Cupid. He uses it to play his lyre and sings about love. The music attracts the attention of woodland creatures and Cupid himself joins in.  2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the passage describes a series of events that would take some time to unfold. Let's say the events take about an hour.  3: 1 hour has elapsed. 60 minutes in an hour, so 60 minutes. 4: 60 minutes. 5: High confidence.
90	LewiMMR.txt|255|u	He was proceeding, but Elvira interrupted him 'Ah! Don Lorenzo, you forget in that pompous title the meanness of my origin.  You forget that I have now passed fourteen years in Spain, disavowed by my husband's family, and existing upon a stipend barely sufficient for the support and education of my daughter. Nay, I have even been neglected by most of my own relations, who out of envy affect to doubt the reality of my marriage. My allowance being discontinued at my father-in-law's death, I was reduced to the very brink of want. In this situation I was found by my sister, who, amongst all her foibles, possesses a warm, generous, and affectionate heart. She aided me with the little fortune which my father left her, persuaded me to visit Madrid, and has supported my child and myself since our quitting Murcia. Then, consider not Antonia as descended from the Condé de las Cisternas; consider her as a poor and unprotected orphan, as the grand-child of the tradesman Torribio Dalfa, as the needy pensioner of that tradesman's daughter. Reflect upon the difference between such a situation and that of the nephew and heir of the potent  duke of Medina. I believe your intentions to be honourable; but as there are no hopes that your uncle will approve of the union, I foresee that the consequences of your attachment must be fatal to my child's repose.' 	2.0	5	[0, 2, 3, 1]	VALID	1: Elvira interrupts Don Lorenzo, reminding him of her humble origins and the difficulties she has faced since her husband's death. She expresses concern about the potential consequences of Don Lorenzo's attachment to her daughter, Antonia. 2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage, but Elvira's speech is lengthy and detailed, suggesting that it might have taken several minutes to deliver. Let's estimate five minutes. 3: 5 minutes have elapsed. 4: 5 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
91	LewiMMR.txt|315|u	 Ambrosio perceived his mistake, and replaced the book upon the table. Antonia spoke of her mother's health with all the enthusiastic joy of a youthful heart. 'I admire your filial affection,' said the abbot; 'it proves the excellence and sensibility of your character; it promises a treasure to him whom Heaven has destined to possess your affections. The breast so capable of fondness for a parent, what will it feel for a lover? Nay, perhaps, what feels it for one even now? Tell me, my lovely daughter, have you known what it is to love? Answer me with sincerity: forget my habit, and consider me only as a friend.' 'What it is to love?' said she, repeating his question. 'Oh! yes, undoubtedly; I have loved many, many people.' 'That is not what I mean. The love of which I speak can be felt only for one.  Have you never seen the man whom you wished to be your husband?' 'Oh! no, indeed!' This was an untruth, but she was unconscious of its falsehood: she knew not the nature of her sentiments for Lorenzo; and never having seen him since his first visit to Elvira, with every day his image grew less feebly impressed upon her bosom: besides, she thought of a husband with all a virgin's terror, and negatived the friar's demand without a moment's hesitation. 	6.0	5	[1, 2, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The abbot asks Antonia if she has ever been in love, and she denies it. 2: Antonia's denial is immediate, so we can assume that no time has passed between the abbot's question and her answer. However, the abbot has already been speaking with Antonia and Ambrosio before this exchange, so let's say that five minutes have passed.  3: Five minutes have elapsed.  4: 5 minutes. 5: High confidence.
92	LewiMMR.txt|384|u	No other sound was heard. The taper, now burnt down to the socket, sometimes flaring upwards, shot a gleam of light through the room, then sinking again seemed upon the point of expiring. Antonia's heart throbbed with agitation; her eyes wandered fearfully over the objects around her, as the trembling flame illuminated them at intervals. She attempted to rise from her seat, but her limbs trembled so violently that she was unable to proceed. She then called Flora, who was in a room at no great distance; but agitation choked  her voice, and her cries died away in hollow murmurs. She passed some minutes in this situation, after which her terrors began to diminish. She strove to recover herself, and acquire strength enough to quit the room. Suddenly she fancied that she heard a low sigh drawn near her. This idea brought back her former weakness. She had already raised herself from her seat, and was on the point of taking the lamp from the table. The imaginary noise stopped her; she drew back her hand, and supported herself upon the back of a chair. She listened anxiously, but nothing more was heard. 'Gracious God!' she said to herself, 'what could be that sound? Was I deceived, or did I really hear it?' 	5.0	5	[0, 1, 2, 3]	VALID	1: Antonia is alone in a room with a taper that is about to go out. She is afraid and tries to call for help, but her voice fails her. She hears a sound and becomes even more frightened.  2: Antonia's actions and thoughts are described in detail, but there is no explicit reference to time. Let's say that the events described take about five minutes.  3: Five minutes have elapsed.  4: 5 minutes.  5: High confidence.
93	LewiMMR.txt|463|u	He lifted her, still motionless, from the tomb: he seated himself upon a bank of stone, and, supporting her in his arms, watched impatiently for the symptoms of returning animation. Scarcely could he command his passions sufficiently, to restrain himself from enjoying her while yet insensible. His natural lust was increased in ardour by the difficulties which had opposed his satisfying it; as also by his long abstinence from woman, since, from the moment of resigning her claim to his love, Matilda had exiled him from her arms for ever. 'I am no prostitute, Ambrosio,' had she told him, when, in the fullness of his lust, he demanded her favours with more than usual earnestness; 'I am now no more than your friend, and will not be your mistress.  Cease then to solicit my complying with desires which insult me. While your heart was mine, I gloried in your embraces. Those happy times are past; my person is become indifferent to you, and 'tis necessity, not love, which makes you seek my enjoyment. I cannot yield to a request so humiliating to my pride.' Suddenly deprived of pleasures, the use of which had made them an absolute want, the monk felt this restraint severely. Naturally addicted to the gratification of the senses, in the full vigour of manhood and heat of blood, he had suffered his temperament to acquire such ascendency, that his lust was become madness. Of his fondness for Antonia, none but the grosser particles remained; he longed for the possession of her person; and even the gloom of the vault, the surrounding silence, and the resistance which he expected from her, seemed to give a fresh edge to his fierce and unbridled desires. 	20160.0	5	[0, 1, 2, 3]	VALID	1: A man has lifted a woman out of a tomb and is waiting for her to regain consciousness. He is tempted to take advantage of her while she is unconscious, but remembers that she has previously refused him.  2: The passage describes a moment of waiting, but also includes a flashback to a conversation in which the woman refused the man's advances. The flashback might have taken place weeks or months earlier. The waiting might have taken only a few minutes. Let's say five minutes.  3: Five minutes have elapsed.  4: 5 minutes.  5: High confidence.
94	LewiMMR.txt|504|u	As I threw a look of terror round my prison, as I shrunk from the cutting wind which howled through my subterraneous dwelling, the change seemed so striking, so abrupt, that I doubted its reality. That the duke de Medina's niece, that the destined bride of the marquis de las Cisternas, one bred up in affluence, related to the noblest families in Spain, and rich in a multitude of affectionate friends that she should in one moment become a captive, separated from the world for ever, weighed down with chains, and reduced to support life with the coarsest aliments appeared a change so sudden and incredible, that I believed myself the sport of some frightful vision. Its continuance convinced me of  my mistake with but too much certainty. Every morning I looked for some relief from my sufferings: every morning my hopes were disappointed. At length I abandoned all idea of escaping, I resigned myself to my fate, and only expected liberty when she came the companion of death. My mental anguish, and the dreadful scenes in which I had been an actress, advanced the period of my labour. In solitude and misery, abandoned by all, unassisted by art, uncomforted by friendship, with pangs which if witnessed would have touched the hardest heart, was I delivered of my wretched burthen. It came alive into the world; but I knew not how to treat it, or by what means to preserve its existence. I could only bathe it with tears, warm it in my bosom, and offer up prayers for its safety. I was soon deprived of this mournful employment: the want of proper attendance, my ignorance how to nurse it, the bitter cold of the dungeon, and the unwholesome  air which inflated its lungs, terminated my sweet babe's short and painful existence. It expired in a few hours after its birth, and I witnessed its death with agonies which beggar all description. 	141120.0	20160	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: A woman is imprisoned and gives birth to a child, which dies soon after. She suffers greatly and is alone. 2: The passage describes the woman's mental anguish and physical suffering over an extended period of time, including the birth and death of her child. It's difficult to estimate how long this would take, but it seems likely that it would take at least several days, if not weeks or months. Let's say two weeks. 3: Two weeks have elapsed. At 7 days a week that's 14 days. 24 hours in a day, so 336 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 20160 minutes. 4: 20160 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
95	LewiMMR.txt|540|u	'Not quit these mountains alive?' he exclaimed: 'Perfidious, what mean you? Have you forgotten our contract?' The fiend answered by a malicious laugh: 'Our contract? Have I not performed my part? What more did I promise than to  save you from your prison? Have I not done so? Are you not safe from the Inquisition safe from all but from me? Fool that you were to confide yourself to a devil! Why did you not stipulate for life, and power, and pleasure? Then all would have been granted: now, your reflections come too late. Miscreant, prepare for death; you have not many hours to live!' On hearing this sentence, dreadful were the feelings of the devoted wretch! He sank upon his knees, and raised his hands towards heaven. The fiend read his intention, and prevented it 'What?' he cried, darting at him a look of fury: 'Dare you still implore the Eternal's mercy? Would you feign penitence, and again act an hypocrite's part? Villain, resign your hopes of pardon. Thus I secure my prey!' As he said this, darting his talons into the monk's shaven crown, he sprang with him from the rock. The caves and mountains rang with Ambrosio's shrieks. The daemon  continued to soar aloft, till reaching a dreadful height, he released the sufferer. Headlong fell the monk through the airy waste; the sharp point of a rock received him; and he rolled from precipice to precipice, till, bruised and mangled, he rested on the river's banks.	2.5	10080	[2, 1, 3, 0]	VALID	1: A fiend reminds a monk of their contract, which the monk has apparently misunderstood. The fiend then kills the monk by dropping him from a great height.  2: The events described are brief and take place in a few seconds. However, the fiend mentions that the monk has only a few hours to live, which implies that some time has passed since the monk's imprisonment. Let's say a week has passed.  3: One week has elapsed. At seven days a week that's 7 days x 24 hours in a day, so 168 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 10080 minutes.  4: 10080 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
96	LewiMMR.txt|541|u	Life still existed in his miserable frame: he attempted in vain to raise himself; his broken and dislocated limbs refused to perform their office, nor was he able to quit the spot where he had first fallen. The sun now rose above the horizon; its scorching beams darted full upon the head of the expiring sinner. Myriads of infects were called forth by the warmth; they drank the blood which trickled from Ambrosio's wounds; he had no power to drive them from him, and they fastened upon his sores, darted their stings into his body, covered him with their multitudes, and inflicted on him tortures the most exquisite and insupportable. The eagles of the rock tore his flesh piecemeal, and dug out his eye-balls with their crooked  beaks. A burning thirst tormented him; he heard the river's murmur as it rolled beside him, but strove in vain to drag himself towards the sound. Blind, maimed, helpless, and despairing, venting his rage in blasphemy and curses, execrating his existence, yet dreading the arrival of death destined to yield him up to greater torments, six miserable days did the villain languish. On the seventh a violent storm arose: the winds in fury rent up rocks and forests: the sky was now black with clouds, now sheeted with fire: the rain fell in torrents; it swelled the stream; the waves overflowed their banks; they reached the spot where Ambrosio lay, and, when they abated, carried with them into the river the corse of the despairing monk.  FINIS.       	10080.0	10080	[0, 3, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The passage describes the death of a sinner who has been lying helpless for six days, then is killed by a storm. 2: The passage describes six days of suffering, but it's unclear how much time is covered by the description of the storm. Let's say the storm lasts for a day.  3: Seven days have elapsed. At 24 hours a day that's 168 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 10080 minutes. 4: 10080 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
97	janeeyre.txt|0|u	CHAPTER I   There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.  I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.  The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy. Me, she had dispensed from joining the group; saying, 'She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy, little children.'  'What does Bessie say I have done?' I asked. 	1440.0	120	[0, 3, 1, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator describes a cold, rainy day when it is impossible to go outside. She reflects on how she dislikes long walks and feels inferior to her cousins. She then describes her exclusion from a group of happy children by her aunt, who wants her to be more sociable and childlike.  2: The events of the passage are mostly internal reflections and dialogue, but there is a reference to a walk in the morning and a mention of dinner. Let's say the morning walk took an hour and dinner took an hour, so two hours total.  3: Two hours have elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour, that's 120 minutes.  4: 120 minutes. 5: High confidence.

Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent.'  A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there. It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the window- seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement.  Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast.  I returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite as a blank. They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of 'the solitary rocks and promontories' by them only inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape--  'Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls, Boils round the naked, melancholy isles Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge Pours in among the stormy Hebrides.' 	10.0	25	[2, 1, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator is scolded by someone named Jane and goes into a breakfast room to read a book. The narrator looks out the window and studies the weather and the book's illustrations.  2: The narrator spends some time being scolded, then goes into the breakfast room and reads a book. The narrator spends some time looking out the window and studying the illustrations. Let's say the scolding takes five minutes, and the reading and studying take 20 minutes.  3: 25 minutes have elapsed.  4: 25 minutes.  5: High confidence.

They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk, and furs. The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a false front of French curls.  These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the room. It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned the laundress, and lectured the superintendent. They now proceeded to address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and enchanted my attention. 	5.0	5	[0, 1, 2, 3]	VALID	1: Mr. Brocklehurst is lecturing a woman about the impropriety of her students' clothing when three visitors enter the room. The visitors are described in detail. 2: The events of the passage take place in a single room and are described in detail, but there is no explicit reference to time. Let's say that the events take five minutes. 3: 5 minutes. 4: 5 minutes. 5: High confidence.
100	janeeyre.txt|184|u	When I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant; and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye, traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.  I did not like re-entering Thornfield. To pass its threshold was to return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only, was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,--to slip again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I was becoming incapable of appreciating. What good it would have done me at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for the calm amidst which I now repined! Yes, just as much good as it would do a man tired of sitting still in a 'too easy chair' to take a long walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances, as it would be under his. 	3.0	3	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator stops at a stile, looks around and listens, then sees a light in a window and hurries on. The narrator then reflects on returning to Thornfield and spending the evening with Mrs. Fairfax. 2: The events described in the passage would have taken a few minutes at most. The narrator stops for a minute at the stile, then hurries on. The reflection on returning to Thornfield and spending the evening with Mrs. Fairfax is brief.  3: Let's say three minutes have elapsed.  4: 3 minutes. 5: High confidence.
101	janeeyre.txt|200|u	 'Were you happy when you painted these pictures?' asked Mr. Rochester presently.  'I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy. To paint them, in short, was to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known.'  'That is not saying much. Your pleasures, by your own account, have been few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's dreamland while you blent and arranged these strange tints. Did you sit at them long each day?'  'I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply.'  'And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?'  'Far from it. I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite powerless to realise.'  'Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more, probably. You had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar. As to the thoughts, they are elfish. These eyes in the Evening Star you must have seen in a dream. How could you make them look so clear, and yet not at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays. And what meaning is that in their solemn depth? And who taught you to paint wind? 	2.0	3360	[0, 2, 3, 1]	VALID	1: Mr. Rochester asks the narrator about her happiness while painting pictures. She explains that she was happy and absorbed, and painted from morning till night during vacation. Mr. Rochester asks about the quality of her work and the meaning behind it. 2: The narrator says she painted from morning till night, but doesn't specify how many days. Let's assume she painted for a week, which would be a typical length of vacation. Painting for 8 hours a day for 7 days would be 56 hours. 3: 56 hours. Multiplying by 60 minutes in an hour, that's 3360 minutes. 4: 3360 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
102	janeeyre.txt|257|u	 Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit. Thanks to it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which, had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to maintain, even externally.     CHAPTER XVII   A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and still he did not come. Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent, and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected. When I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill and failing at the heart. I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles, I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got over the temporary blunder--how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr. 	14400.0	131040	[2, 1, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator reflects on how she has disciplined herself to remain calm in the face of uncertainty. A week passes without news of Mr. Rochester, and Mrs. Fairfax speculates that he may be gone for a year. The narrator feels disappointed but regains her composure. 2: A week passes before the narrator hears from Mrs. Fairfax. It's unclear how much time passes between the narrator's initial disappointment and her regaining her composure, but let's say it takes a few minutes. Mrs. Fairfax's speculation that Mr. Rochester may be gone for a year is just that, so we can't be sure how much time will actually pass. Let's say six months.  3: The range of possible times is between one week and six months. The midpoint is 13 weeks, or 91 days. Multiplying by 24 hours in a day and 60 minutes in an hour, we get 131,040 minutes. 4: 131,040 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
103	janeeyre.txt|355|u	And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with man.  When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either to one's self or one's kin. The saying might have worn out of my memory, had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix it there. The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her little sister.  Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water. It was a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it nestled close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber. 	10080.0	210	[1, 0, 2, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator recalls a childhood memory of a woman who dreamed of a child and then had a family tragedy. The narrator then describes a series of dreams she has had about a child over the past week. 2: The narrator describes a series of dreams over the course of a week. It's unclear how long each dream lasts, but let's say each dream lasts 30 minutes.  3: Seven dreams at 30 minutes each is 210 minutes. 4: 210 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
104	janeeyre.txt|358|u	 I was silent: the things were frightful. Robert Leaven resumed--  'Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of poverty were quite breaking her down. The information about Mr. John's death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke. She was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making signs to my wife and mumbling. It was only yesterday morning, however, that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she made out the words, 'Bring Jane--fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to her.' Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and advised them to send for you. The young ladies put it off at first; but their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times, that at last they consented. I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow morning.'  'Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go.'  'I think so too, Miss. Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse: but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?' 	2.0	259210	[0, 2, 1, 3]	VALID	1: Robert Leaven tells Jane Eyre that her former guardian, Mrs. Reed, has had a stroke and has asked to see Jane. Robert has come to take Jane back to Gateshead. 2: There is no explicit reference to time, but Mrs. Reed's stroke and subsequent death suggest that some time has passed since Jane left Gateshead. Let's say six months have passed. The conversation between Robert and Jane would take at least a few minutes.  3: Six months plus a few minutes. Six months is 180 days x 24 hours in a day, so 4320 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 259200 minutes. Adding a few minutes, let's say 259210 minutes. 4: 259210 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
105	janeeyre.txt|561|u	 On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry. My black silk frock hung against the wall. The traces of the bog were removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite decent. My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered presentable. There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and brush to smooth my hair. After a weary process, and resting every five minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself. My clothes hung loose on me; for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once more, clean and respectable looking--no speck of the dirt, no trace of the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left--I crept down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.  It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous fire. Hannah was baking. Prejudices, it is well known, are most difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones. Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly she had begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in tidy and well-dressed, she even smiled. 	25.0	25	[2, 3, 1, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator wakes up in a room with her clothes cleaned and dried. She dresses herself, goes down a staircase, and enters a kitchen where Hannah is baking. Hannah smiles at the narrator. 2: The narrator dresses herself, which takes some time, but it's unclear how long. She then descends a staircase and enters a kitchen. Let's say the dressing process takes 20 minutes, and the descent and entrance take another 5.  3: 25 minutes have elapsed.  4: 25 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
106	janeeyre.txt|589|u	 He left the room. In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.  Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached for leaving their brother and their home. They both tried to appear as usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not be entirely conquered or concealed. Diana intimated that this would be a different parting from any they had ever yet known. It would probably, as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it might be a parting for life.  'He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves,' she said: 'natural affection and feelings more potent still. St. John looks quiet, Jane; but he hides a fever in his vitals. You would think him gentle, yet in some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it. It is right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!' And the tears gushed to her fine eyes. Mary bent her head low over her work.  'We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,' she murmured. 	10080.0	20	[0, 1, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator reflects on how much she has learned about St. John in the past hour. Diana and Mary Rivers are sad about leaving their home and brother, St. John, who is making a difficult decision.  2: The events described in the passage are mostly internal reflections and conversations. It's hard to say how much time has passed, but let's say that the narrator has been reflecting for 10 minutes and the conversation between Diana and Mary takes another 10 minutes.  3: 20 minutes have elapsed. 4: 20 minutes. 5: Low confidence, as the estimate is based on speculation.
107	janeeyre.txt|595|u	 Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile from the village. The birds were singing their last strains--  'The air was mild, the dew was balm.'  While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself ere long weeping--and why? For the doom which had reft me from adhesion to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and fatal fury--consequences of my departure--which might now, perhaps, be dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate restoration thither. At this thought, I turned my face aside from the lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton--I say _lonely_, for in that bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived. I hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone frame of my door; but soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the meadow beyond it made me look up. A dog--old Carlo, Mr. Rivers' pointer, as I saw in a moment--was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John himself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave almost to displeasure, fixed on me. I asked him to come in. 	8.0	3	[0, 1, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator looks at the sunset, thinks about his former master, and weeps. He hears a noise and sees St. John outside his gate.  2: The events described in the passage are mostly mental and emotional, but the narrator also looks at the sunset and hears a noise outside. These actions might take a few minutes.  3: Let's say three minutes have elapsed.  4: 3 minutes. 5: High confidence.
108	janeeyre.txt|603|u	Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she for a woman. His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty. But he curbed it, I think, as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed. He responded neither by word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.  'Papa says you never come to see us now,' continued Miss Oliver, looking up. 'You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall. He is alone this evening, and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?'  'It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver,' answered St. John.  'Not a seasonable hour! But I declare it is. It is just the hour when papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no business to occupy him. Now, Mr. Rivers, _do_ come. Why are you so very shy, and so very sombre?' She filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of her own.  'I forgot!' she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if shocked at herself. 'I am so giddy and thoughtless! _Do_ excuse me. It had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for joining in my chatter. Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is shut up, and you are so lonely. I am sure I pity you. Do come and see papa.' 	2.0	3	[1, 2, 0, 3]	VALID	1: St. John is at Vale Hall, where he is approached by Miss Oliver. She invites him to visit her father, who is alone and unwell. St. John hesitates, but Miss Oliver insists. 2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time. However, the conversation between St. John and Miss Oliver would have taken at least a few minutes. Let's say three minutes. 3: Three minutes have elapsed. 4: 3 minutes. 5: High confidence.
109	janeeyre.txt|699|u	 It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time. I filled the interval in walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had given my plans their present bent. I recalled that inward sensation I had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable strangeness. I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned whence it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_--not in the external world. I asked was it a mere nervous impression--a delusion? I could not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration. The wondrous shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations of Paul and Silas's prison; it had opened the doors of the soul's cell and loosed its bands--it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous body.  'Ere many days,' I said, as I terminated my musings, 'I will know something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me. Letters have proved of no avail--personal inquiry shall replace them.'  At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey, and should be absent at least four days.  'Alone, Jane?' they asked. 	120.0	125	[2, 1, 0, 3]	VALID	1: The protagonist reflects on a strange experience from the previous night, then decides to go on a journey and announces it to two other characters at breakfast. 2: The protagonist spends two hours walking around their room and reflecting. They then announce their journey at breakfast, which would take a few minutes. Let's say five minutes. 3: Two hours and five minutes have elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour that's 125 minutes. 4: 125 minutes. 5: High confidence.
110	janeeyre.txt|707|u	 'Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?' I asked, knowing, of course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the direct question as to where he really was.  'No, ma'am--oh, no! No one is living there. I suppose you are a stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last autumn,--Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about harvest-time. A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved. The fire broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from Millcote, the building was one mass of flame. It was a terrible spectacle: I witnessed it myself.'  'At dead of night!' I muttered. Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality at Thornfield. 'Was it known how it originated?' I demanded.  'They guessed, ma'am: they guessed. Indeed, I should say it was ascertained beyond a doubt. You are not perhaps aware,' he continued, edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, 'that there was a lady--a--a lunatic, kept in the house?'  'I have heard something of it.'  'She was kept in very close confinement, ma'am: people even for some years was not absolutely certain of her existence. No one saw her: they only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what she was it was difficult to conjecture. They said Mr. Edward had brought her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress. But a queer thing happened a year since--a very queer thing.' 	2.0	5	[2, 3, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The speaker asks about Mr. Rochester's whereabouts, and is told that Thornfield Hall has burned down. The speaker asks how the fire started and learns that there was a woman kept in confinement there. 2: The passage describes a conversation, which would take a few minutes at least. The fire and the woman's confinement are both in the past, but the conversation is in the present. Let's say the conversation takes five minutes. 3: Five minutes have elapsed. 4: 5 minutes. 5: High confidence.
111	janeeyre.txt|749|u	He and I went up to London. He had the advice of an eminent oculist; andhe eventually recovered the sight of that one eye. He cannot now see very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his way without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him--the earth no longer a void. When his first-born was put into his arms, he could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they once were--large, brilliant, and black. On that occasion, he again, with a full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy. My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most love are happy likewise. Diana and Mary Rivers are both married: alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see them. Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good man. Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother's, and, from his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection. Both Captain Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by them. As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India. He entered on the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still. A more resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.	3500000.0	259200	[1, 3, 2, 0]	VALID	1: The passage describes the aftermath of a man's partial recovery of sight, and the happiness of the narrator and her family. It also mentions the marriages of two women and the departure of a man to India.  2: The passage describes a series of events that have already happened, so we can't know exactly how long they took. However, the passage does describe a number of events, including a trip to London, a visit from Diana and Mary Rivers, and St. John Rivers' departure to India. These events suggest that at least several months have passed. Let's say six months.  3: Six months have elapsed. At 30 days a month that's 180 days. 24 hours in a day, so 4320 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 259200 minutes. 4: 259200 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the passage is vague about the time frame.
112	janeeyre.txt|750|u	Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it. He may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from the onslaught of Apollyon. His is the exaction of the apostle, who speaks but for Christ, when he says--'Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.' His is the ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth--who stand without fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.  St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now. Himself has hitherto sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun hastens to its setting. The last letter I received from him drew from my eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated his sure reward, his incorruptible crown. I know that a stranger's hand will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been called at length into the joy of his Lord. And why weep for this? No fear of death will darken St. John's last hour: his mind will be unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith steadfast. His own words are a pledge of this--  'My Master,' he says, 'has forewarned me. Daily He announces more distinctly,--'Surely I come quickly!' and hourly I more eagerly respond,--'Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!'' 	525600.0	26280000	[1, 3, 0, 2]	VALID	1: This passage describes a man named St. John, who is unmarried and devoted to his work. The narrator anticipates that he will die soon, but with joy and without fear. 2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage. However, the passage describes St. John's life's work and his anticipation of death, which suggests that he is at the end of his life. Let's say that he is in his seventies and has been working for fifty years.  3: Fifty years have elapsed. At 365 days a year that's 18250 days x 24 hours in a day, so 438000 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 26280000 minutes. 4: 26280000 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the estimate is based on speculation about St. John's age and career.
113	RichSHS.txt|0|u	 THE HISTORY OF Sir CHARLES GRANDISON, Bart.  LETTER I. Miss LUCY SELBY, To Miss HARRIET BYRON. Ashby-Canons, January 10. YOUR resolution to accompany Mrs. Reeves to London, has greatly alarmed your three Lovers. And two of them, at least, will let you know that it has. Such a lovely girl as my Harriet, must expect to be more accountable for her steps than one less excellent and less attractive. Mr. Greville, in his usual resolute way, threatens to follow you to London; and there, he says, he will watch the motions of every man who approaches you; and, if he find reason for it, will early let such man know his pretensions, and the danger he may run into, if he pretend to be his competitor. But let me not do him injustice; though he talks of a rival thus harshly, he speaks of you more highly than man ever spoke of woman. Angel and Goddess are phrases you have been used to from him; and tho' spoken in  his humorous way, yet I am sure he most sincerely admires you. Mr. Fenwick, in a less determined manner, declares, that he will follow you to town, if you stay there above one fortnight. The gentle Orme sighs his apprehensions, and wishes you would change your purpose. Tho' hopeless, he says, it is some pleasure to him, that he can think himself in the same county with you; and much more, that he can tread in your footsteps to and from church every Sunday, and behold you there. He wonders how your grandmamma, your aunt, your uncle, can spare you. Your cousin Reeves's surely, he says, are very happy in their influences over us all. 	20160.0	10	[1, 0, 2, 3]	VALID	1: Miss Lucy Selby writes to Miss Harriet Byron, telling her that her decision to go to London has alarmed her three suitors, who have all threatened to follow her there. 2: The passage describes the reactions of three men to Harriet's decision to go to London. It's unclear how long it took for Harriet to make this decision, but let's say it took her a day or two. The men's reactions are described in a few sentences, so let's say that took a few minutes.  3: Let's say 10 minutes have elapsed.  4: 10 minutes. 5: High confidence.
114	RichSHS.txt|1|u	Each of the gentlemen is afraid, that by increasing the number of your admirers, you will increase his difficulties: But what is that to them, I asked, when they already know, that you are not inclined to favour any of the three? If you hold your resolution, and my cousin Reeves's their time of setting out, pray let me know, and I will attend you at my uncle Selby's, to wish you a good journey, much pleasure in town, and a return with a safe and sound heart. My sister, who, poor dear girl, continues extremely weak and low, will spare me for a purpose so indispensable. I will not have you come to us. I know it would grieve you to see her in the way she is in. You too much take to heart the infirmities of your friends which you cannot cure; and as your grandmamma lives upon your smiles, and you rejoice all your friends by your chearfulness, it would be cruel to make you sad. MR. GREVILLE has just left us. He dropt in upon us as we were going to dinner. My grandmother Selby you know is always pleased with his rattling. She prevailed on him to alight, and sit down with us. All his talk was of you. He repeated his  former threatenings (as I called them to him) on your going to town. After dinner, he read us a Letter from Lady Frampton relating to you.	10080.0	120	[1, 3, 0, 2]	VALID	1: The letter-writer is discussing the reactions of various gentlemen to the addressee's popularity, and offers to meet her to wish her a good journey. She also mentions that her sister is ill and that Mr. Greville has just left. 2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the events described (conversation, dinner, reading a letter) would take at least an hour or two.  3: Let's say two hours have elapsed. That's 120 minutes. 4: 120 minutes. 5: High confidence.
115	RichSHS.txt|398|u	Hopeless passion, said she? Entangled in an hopeless passion! O let me die before this shall be deserved to be said of your Harriet! Then again rises to your pen, smothering and escaped sparks; and I am desired to hurry myself to get cold water to quench the flame Dear, dear madam, what images are here? And applied To whom? And by whom? Have I written any thing so very blazing! Surely I have not. But you should not say you will all forgive me, if this be my sad situation. You should not say, How much you are yourselves, all of you, in love with this excellent man; and talk of Mr. Dawson, and of what he says of him: But you should have told me, that if I suffer my gratitude to grow into Love, you will never forgive me; then should I have had a call of duty to check or controul a passion, that you were afraid could not be gratified. Well, and there is no way left me, it seems, but to fly for it! To hurry away to Northamptonshire, and either to begin a new treaty with Lord D. or to give hope to an old Lover. Poor Harriet Byron! And is it indeed so bad with thee? And does thy aunt Selby think it is!  But is there no hope, that the man will take pity of thee? When he sees thee so sadly entangled, will he not vouchsafe to lend an extricating hand? 	1440.0	180	[2, 1, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The passage is a monologue in which a woman reflects on her feelings for a man and her aunt's advice.  2: The passage is mostly introspective, but the woman does mention hurrying to get cold water, which would take a few minutes. Additionally, the woman mentions the possibility of traveling to Northamptonshire, which would take at least a few hours. Let's say 3 hours.  3: 3 hours have elapsed. Multiplying by 60 minutes an hour that's 180 minutes. 4: 180 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
116	RichSHS.txt|517|u	Lady D. But what are his employments? What can he be so much busied in? M ss Gr. A continual round of good offices. He has a ward. She has a large fortune. The attention he pays to her affairs takes up a good deal of his time. He is his own steward; and then he has a variety of other engagements, of which we ask him not one word; yet long to know something about them. But this we are sure of, that, if he thinks any-thing will give us pleasure, we shall hear of it: if the contrary, he is as secret as the night. Will nobody say one bad or one indifferent thing of this man, Lucy? There is no bearing these things! O my dear, what a Nobody is your poor Harriet? Lady D. He is one of the handsomest men in England, they tell me. Miss Gr. Sisters are not judges. They may be partial. His benignity of heart makes his face shine. Had I a lover but half as handsome as I think my brother, I should make no objection to him on the account of person. Lady L. But he is the genteelest of men! What think you, sister Harriet? Harriet. Sisters are not judges. They may be partial. What meant Lady L. to apply to me? But I had been some time silent. She could not mean any-thing:  And both sisters complimented me on recognizing the relation. 	120.0	5	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: Three women discuss a man's busy schedule and good character. They compliment each other. 2: The passage is entirely dialogue, so it's hard to say how much time has passed. However, the women seem to be having a leisurely conversation, so let's say five minutes. 3: 5 minutes have elapsed. 4: 5 minutes. 5: High confidence.
117	RichSHS.txt|643|u	Dear Sir! said Caroline, flinging herself on her knees by me, forgive my sister! Dear, good Sir! whatever becomes of me, forgive your Charlotte! Sir Tho. You are fearless of your destiny, Caroline. You will throw yourself into the arms of Lord L. I doubt not. I will send for your brother. But you shall both leave this house. I will shut it up the moment you are gone. It shall never again be open'd while I live. When my ashes are mingled with those of your mother, then may you keep open house in it, and trample under foot the ashes of both. I sobbed out, Dear Sir, forgive me! I meant not to reflect upon my father, when I wish'd for my mother. I wish'd for her for your sake, Sir, as well as for ours. She would have mediated. She would have soften'd Sir Tho. My hard heart I know what you mean, Charlotte! And flung from us a few paces, walking about in wrath, leaving us kneeling at his vacant chair. He then, ringing the bell, the door in his hand, ordered in the housekeeper. She enter'd. A very good woman she was. She trembled for her kneeling Ladies.  Sir Th. Beckford, do you assist these girls in getting up every thing that belongs to them. Give me an inventory of what they take. Their father's authority is grievous to them. They want to shake it off. They find themselves women-grown. They want husbands Indeed, indeed, Beckford, we don't, said Caroline; interrupted by my father Do you give me the lye, bold-face? 	5.0	10	[0, 3, 2, 1]	VALID	1: Two sisters plead with their father to forgive their sister, who has apparently done something wrong. The father is angry and threatens to shut down the house and send the sisters away. The housekeeper is called in to help the sisters pack. 2: The events described in the passage, including dialogue and movement, would have taken at least 10 minutes.  3: 10 minutes have elapsed. 4: 10 minutes. 5: High confidence.
118	RichSHS.txt|1068|u	Miss Gr. Love him! love Lord G.? What a question is that! Why no! I verily believe, that I can't say that. Sir. Ch. Can you esteem him? Miss Gr. Esteem! Why that's a quaint word, tho' a female one. I believe, if I were to marry the honest man, I could be civil to him, if he would be very complaisant, very observant, and all that Pray, brother, don't, however, be angry with me. Sir Ch. I will not, Charlotte, smiling. It is constitution, you say. But if y u cannot be more than civil; and if he is to be very observant; you'll make it your agreement with him, before you meet him at the altar, that he shall subscribe to the woman's part of the vow; and that you shall answer to the man's. Miss Gr. A good thought, I believe! I'll consider of it. If I find, in courtship, the man will bear it, I may make the proposal. Yet I don't know, but it will be as well to suppose the vow changed, without conditioning for it, as other good women do; and act accordingly. One would not begin with a singularity, for fear of putting the parson out. I heard an excellent Lady once advise a good wise, who, however, very little wanted it, to give the man a hearing, and never do any thing that he would wish to be done, except she chose to do it. If the man loves quiet, he'll be glad to compound. 	2.0	5	[1, 3, 2, 0]	VALID	1: A man and a woman are discussing the woman's feelings towards Lord G. She says she can't say she loves him, but might be able to be civil to him if he is very observant. The man suggests that she make an agreement with Lord G. before they get married, and the woman considers this idea. 2: The conversation is brief and doesn't include any explicit references to time. However, it takes time to have a conversation, even a brief one. Let's say the conversation takes five minutes. 3: 5 minutes. 4: 5 minutes. 5: High confidence.
119	RichSHS.txt|1084|u	Miss Gr. Well, and you like me, just now? That's the beauty of it; to offend and make up, at pleasure. Old Terence was a shrewd man: The falling out of Lovers, says he (as Lord L. once quoted him), is the renewal of Love. Are we not now better friends, than if we had never differed? And do you think that I will not, if I marry, exercise my husband's patience now-and-then for this very purpose? Let me alone, Harriet: Now a quarrel; now a reconciliation; I warrant I shall be happier than any of the yawning see-saws in the kingdom. Everlasting summers would be a grievance. Harriet. You may be right, if you are exceeding discreet in your perversenesses, Charlotte; and yet if  you are, you will not lay out for a quarrel, I fansy. The world, or you will have better luck than your brother seems to have had, will find you opportunities enow, for exercising the tempers of both, without your needing to study for occasions. Miss Gr. Study for them, Harriet! I sha'n't study for them, neither: They will come of course. Harriet. I was about to ask a question But 'tis better let alone. Miss Gr. I will have it. What was your question? Don't you see what a good-natured fool I am? You may say any-thing to me: I won't be angry. Harriet. I was going to ask you, If you were ever concernd two hours together, for any fault you ever committed in your life? 	2.0	5	[0, 1, 2, 3]	VALID	1: Two women, Miss Gr and Harriet, discuss the benefits of quarreling and making up in relationships. Harriet asks Miss Gr if she has ever felt guilty for any fault she has committed. 2: The conversation is brief and doesn't include any explicit reference to time. However, the conversation is not immediate and would have taken some time to occur. Let's say the conversation took five minutes. 3: 5 minutes. 4: 5 minutes. 5: High confidence.
120	RichSHS.txt|1108|u	I walked by the side of it, and in this manner moved towards Cremona, in order to shorten the way of the expected surgeon. My servant soon returned with one. Jeronymo had sainted away. The surgeon dressed him, and proceeded with him to Cremona. Then it was, that, opening his eyes, he beheld, and knew me; and being told, by the sugeon, that he owed his preservation to me, O Grandison! said he, that I had followed your advice! that I had kept my promise with you! How did I insult you! Can my deliverer forgive me? You shall be the director of my future life, if it please God to restore me. His wounds proved not mortal; but he never will be the man he was: Partly from his having been unskilfully treated by this his first surgeon; and partly from his own impatience, and the difficulty of curing the wound in his hip-joint. Excuse this particularity, madam. The subject requires it; and Signor Jeronymo now deserves it, and all your pity. I attended him at Cremona, till he was fit to remove. He was visited there by his whole family from Bologna. There never was a family more affectionate to one another: The suffering of one, is the suffering of every one. The Barone was exceedingly beloved by his father, mother, sister, for the sweetness of his manners, his affectionate heart, and a wit so delightfully gay and lively, that his company was sought by every-body. 	20160.0	5040	[2, 1, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator walks with a servant to Cremona to meet a surgeon, who then treats a man named Jeronymo. Jeronymo wakes up and recognizes the narrator, expressing regret for past behavior. The narrator attends Jeronymo in Cremona until he is well enough to leave, and Jeronymo's family visits him there.  2: The events described in the passage would have taken at least a few hours, given the time it would take to walk to Cremona, find a surgeon, and treat Jeronymo. The passage doesn't give a clear indication of how long Jeronymo was in Cremona, but it seems likely that it was at least a few days, given that his family was able to visit him there. Let's say 3-4 days.  3: 3.5 days have elapsed. At 24 hours a day that's 84 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 5040 minutes.  4: 5040 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
121	RichSHS.txt|1380|u	The daughters are remarkable for their piety, patience, good oeconomy, and prudence. They are the most dutiful of children, and most affectionate of sisters. They were for three years the support of their father's spirits, and have always been the consolation of their mother. They lost their father about four years ago: And it is even edifying to observe▪ how elegantly they support the family reputation in their fine old mansion house by the prudent management of their little income; for the matter leaves every houshold care to them; and they make it a rule to conclude the year with discharging every demand that  can be made upon them, and to commence the new year absolutely clear of the world, and with some cash in hand; yet were brought up in affluence, and to the expectation of handsome fortunes; for, besides that they could have no thought of losing their cause, they had very great and reasonable prospects from Mr Calvert, an uncle by their mother's side; who was rich in money, and had besides an estate in land of 1500 l. a year.	2102400.0	2628000	[1, 2, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The passage describes the daughters of a deceased father who have been supporting their family for three years with their piety, patience, good economy, and prudence. They have always been the consolation of their mother. They manage the family's finances and end each year with no debts and some cash in hand. They were brought up in affluence and had reasonable prospects of inheriting a large estate from their uncle. 2: The passage doesn't give any explicit reference to time, but it does mention that the father died four years ago and the daughters have been supporting the family for three years. It's unclear how long it took for the daughters to take over the family finances and establish their system of ending each year with no debts and some cash in hand. It's also unclear how long it took for the daughters to adjust to their new financial situation after being brought up in affluence. Given these uncertainties, it's reasonable to estimate that the events described took at least a few years. 3: Let's estimate that the events described took five years. Multiplying by 365 days in a year gives 1825 days. Multiplying by 24 hours in a day gives 43800 hours. Multiplying by 60 minutes in an hour gives 2628000 minutes. 4: 2628000 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
122	RichSHS.txt|1547|u	Upon some occasion, Lady G. reflected upon a Lady for prudery; and was going on, when Sir Charles, interrupting her, said, Take care, Lady G. You, Ladies, take care; for I am afraid that MODESTY, under this name, will become ignominious, and be banished the hearts, at least the behaviour and conversation, of all those whose fortunes or inclinations carry them often to places of public resort. Talk of places of public resort! said Lord L.; It is vexatious to observe at such, how men of real merit are neglected by the fine Ladies of the age, while every distinction is shewn to fops and foplings. But, who, my Lord, said Sir Charles, are those women? Are they not generally of a class with those men? Flippant women love empty men, because they cannot reproach them with a superiority of understanding, but keep their solly in countenance. They are afraid of a wise man: But I would by no means have such a one turn sool to please them: For they will despise the wise man's folly more than the silly man's, and with reason; because being uncharacteristic, it must sit more aukwardly upon him than the others can do. Yet wisdom itself, and the truest wisdom, goodness, said Mrs. Reeves, is sometimes thought to sit ungracefully, when it is uncharacteristic, not to the man, but to the times. She then named a person who was branded as an hypocrite, for performing all his duties publicly. 	5.0	12.5	[2, 3, 0, 1]	VALID	1: A group of people are discussing prudery, modesty, and the behavior of men and women in public places. One person mentions a man who was branded as a hypocrite for performing his duties publicly. 2: The passage is a conversation, so it's difficult to estimate how much time has passed. However, the conversation is fairly brief and focused, so it probably took no more than 10-15 minutes. 3: 12.5 minutes have elapsed.  4: 12.5 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
123	RichSHS.txt|1767|u	Hence it was concluded, that she would take some notice of me when she saw me; and I was led  by the General, followed by the rest, into the Marchioness's drawing-room. Father Marescotti had given me an advantageous character of the General's Lady, whom I had not yet seen. The Bishop had told me, that she was such another excellent woman as his mother, and, like her, had the Italian reserve softened by a polite French education, The Marquis, the Count, Father Marescotti, and this real fine Lady, were in the drawingroom. The General presented me to her. I do not, madam, bid you admire the Chevalier Grandison: But I forgive you if you do; because you will not be able to do otherwise. My Lord, said she, you told me an hour ago, that I must: And now, that I see the Chevalier, you will have no cause to reproach me with disobedience. I bowed on her hand. Father Marescotti, madam, said I, bid me expect from the Lady of the young Marchese della Porretta every-thing that was condescending and good. Your compassionate Love for an unhappy new sister, who deserves every-one's Love, exalts your character. Father Marescotti came in. We took our places. It was designed, I found, to try to revive the young Lady's attention, by introducing her in full assembly, I one of it. But I could not forbear asking the Marchioness, if Lady Clementina would not be too much startled at so much company? 	5.0	90	[1, 0, 2, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator is introduced to a group of people, including a Lady who is praised by others. The group plans to introduce the narrator to a young Lady Clementina, but the narrator expresses concern about the young Lady's reaction to so many people. 2: The events described in the passage are mostly social interactions and introductions, which would take a few minutes at most. However, there is a reference to an hour ago, which suggests that at least an hour has passed since the narrator arrived. Let's say an hour and a half. 3: 1.5 hours have elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour that's 90 minutes. 4: 90 minutes. 5: High confidence.
124	RichSHS.txt|2191|u	Not a word did my brother speak of his intention, till he received that Letter; and then he invited Lady L. and me, and our two honest men, to afternoon tea with him [O but I have not reckoned with you for your saucy rebukes in your last of the 7th; I owe you a spite for it; and, Harriet, depend on payment What was I writing? I have it ] And when tea was over, he, without a blush, without looking down, as a girl would do in this situation [But why so, Harriet? Is a woman, on these occasions, to act a part as if she supposed herself to be the greatest gainer by  matrimony; and therefore was ashamed of consenting to accept of an honourable offer? As if, in other words, she was to be the self-denying receiver rather than conferrer of an obligation? Lord, how we rambling-headed creatures break in upon ourselves!] with a good grace he told us of his intention to marry; of his apparition to Mrs. Shirley; of his sudden vanishing; and all that And then he produced Mrs. Shirley's Letter, but just received. And do you think we were not overjoyed? Indeed we were. We congratulated him: We congratulated each other: Lord L. looked as he did when Caroline gave him his happy day: Lord G. could not keep his seat: He was tipsy, poor man, with his joy: Aunt Nell prank'd herself, stroked her ribbands of pink and yellow, and chuckled and mumped for joy, that her nephew at last would not go out of Old England for a wife. She was mightily pleased too with Mrs. Shirley's Letter. It was just such a one as she herself would have written upon the occasion. 	2880.0	60	[1, 2, 0, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator's brother announces his intention to marry, and produces a letter from the woman he intends to marry. The family is overjoyed. 2: The events described in the passage, including tea and conversation, would have taken at least an hour.  3: One hour has elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour, that's 60 minutes. 4: 60 minutes. 5: High confidence.
125	RichSHS.txt|2802|u	I have not yet been able to break to her the daily expectation I have of seeing in England her parents and brothers: Yet am uneasy, that she knows it not. I want courage, my Harriet, to acquaint her with it. I have more than once essayed to do it. Dear creature! she looks with so much innocence, and so much reliance upon me; and is, at times, so apprehensive! I know not how to break it to her. She depends upon my mediation. She urges me to begin a treaty of reconciliation with them. I defer writing, I tell her, till I have seen Mrs. Beaumont.  Little does she think they are upon their journey, and that I know not where to direct to them. She longs for Mrs. Beaumont's arrival; and hopes, she says, she will bring with her the poor Camilla, that she may have an opportunity to obtain her excuse for the harsh treatment she gave her: And yet Camilla, said she, was a teazing woman. Were you ever sensible, my Harriet, of the tender pain that an open heart (yours is an open and an enlarged one) feels; longing, yet, for its friend's sake, afraid, to reveal unwelcome tidings, which, however, it imports the concerned to know? How loth to disturb the tranquillity which is built upon ignorance of the event! Yet that every tranquillity (contemplated upon) adding to the pain of the compassionating friend; who reflects, that when the unhappy news shall be revealed, Time, and Christian philosophy, only, will ever restore it to the heart of the sufferer! 	10080.0	5	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator is reflecting on how difficult it is to tell someone bad news, specifically that their family is coming to England. The narrator is worried about how the person will react and is delaying telling them.  2: The passage is entirely reflective and does not describe any concrete actions. However, even reflection takes some time. Let's say the narrator spends five minutes reflecting on this issue.  3: 5 minutes have elapsed.  4: 5 minutes.  5: High confidence.
126	RichSHS.txt|2817|u	This is what I stole time to write, while Sir Charles is engaged in discourse with the Lady, and our guests are preparing to be gone to Lord G's, Lady G. requesting my aunt's company early. She is the veriest coward! These brave spirits, she has said, are but flash. Indeed the very delicate, as well as very serious, and even solemn, circumstances, which attend her case, must make the liveliest woman, when the time approaches, think! The inclosed note of hers to my aunt, brought late last night, is, however, in her usual stile: YOU and Lucy must be here early To-morrow morning. What wretched simpletons are we women! Daughters of gewgaw, solly, ostentation, trifle! First, we shew our sorry fellow, when not disapproved, to our friends and relations; and take all their judgments  upon him. If he has their opinion in his favour, every-body, be he what he will, will praise him; and give him riches, sense, ancestry, and I cannot tell what of qualities that perhaps we shall never find out. Then we shew our presents, our jewels, our laces; and a smile spreads the mouth, and a sparkle gladdens the eye, of every maiden that hangs admiring over them. Ah, filly maidens! if you could look three yards from your noses, you would pity, instead of envying, the milk-white heifer dressed in ribbands, and just ready to be led to sacrifice. 	1440.0	5	[2, 0, 1, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator writes a note while Sir Charles and Lady G. are talking and guests are preparing to leave. She reflects on the superficiality of women and their tendency to show off their possessions and significant others. 2: The events described in the passage are mostly internal reflections and observations, which take place in the narrator's mind. It's difficult to estimate how long these thoughts would take to form, but let's say it takes a few minutes to write the note and have these thoughts.  3: Let's say five minutes have elapsed.  4: 5 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
127	RichSHS.txt|3009|u	Poor Sir Hargrave Pollexfen! May he have met with mercy from the All-merciful! He gave his will into Sir Charles's hands, soon after he came down. He has made him his sole executor. Have you not been told, that Sir Charles had heretofore reconciled him to his relations and heirs at Law? He had the pleasure of finding the reconciliation sincere. The poor man spoke kindly to them all. They were tenderly careful of him. He acknowleged their care. I cannot write for tears. The poor man, in the last solemn act of his life, has been intendedly kind, but really cruel, to me. I should have been a sincere mourner for him (A life so mispent!) without this act of regard for me He has left me, as a small atonement, he calls it, for the terrors he once gave me, a very large Legacy in money (Sir Charles has not yet told me what) and his jewels and plate And he has left Sir Charles a noble one besides. He died immensely rich. Sir Charles is grieved at both Legacies: And the more, as he cannot give them back to the heirs; for they declare, that he bound them under a solemn oath (and by a curse, if they broke it) not to except back either from Sir Charles, or me, the large bequests he told them he had made us: And they assured Sir Charles, that they would be religiously bound by it. 	4320.0	10080	[0, 3, 1, 2]	VALID	1: Sir Hargrave Pollexfen has died and left a large legacy to the letter-writer, as well as to Sir Charles. The heirs at law are bound by a curse not to contest the will. 2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the events described suggest that at least a few days have passed since Sir Hargrave's death, given that his will has been given to Sir Charles and the heirs at law have been informed of the bequests. Let's say a week has passed. 3: One week has elapsed. At seven days a week that's 7 days. 24 hours in a day, so 168 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 10080 minutes. 4: 10080 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

You, madam, and my aunt Selby, must direct me, when it comes into my hands. Sir Charles intends, that the poor man's memory shall receive true honour from the disposition of his Legacy to him. He is pleased with his Harriet, for the concern she expressed for this unhappy man.  The most indulgent of husbands finds out some reason to praise her for every thing she says and does. But could HE be otherwise than the best of HUSBANDS, who was the most dutiful of SONS; who is the most affectionate of BROTHERS; the most faithful of FRIENDS: Who is good upon principle, in every relation of life? What, my dear grandmamma, is the boasted character of most of those who are called HEROES, to the un-ostentatious merit of a TRULY GOOD MAN? In what a variety of amiable lights does such a one appear? In how many ways is he a blessing and a joy to his fellow-creatures? And this blessing, this joy, your Harriet can call more peculiarly her own! My single heart, methinks, is not big enough to contain the gratitude which such a Lot demands. Let the overflowings of your pious joy, my dearest grandmamma, join with my thankfulness in paying part of the immense debt for Your undeservedly Happy HARRIET GRANDISON. 	80640.0	5	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The passage is a letter in which the writer expresses gratitude for her husband's character and his plans to leave a legacy to the poor. 2: The passage is entirely reflective and does not describe any events that would take time.

129	SteinJGW.txt|0|u	  Chapter 1  TO THE RED COUNTRY and part of the gray country of Oklahoma, the last rains came gently, and they did not cut the scarred earth. The plows crossed and recrossed the rivulet marks. The last rains lifted the corn quickly and scattered weed colonies and grass along the sides of the roads so that the gray country and the dark red country began to disappear under a green cover. In the last part of May the sky grew pale and the clouds that had hung in high puffs for so long in the spring were dissipated. The sun flared down on the growing corn day after day until a line of brown spread along the edge of each green bayonet. The clouds appeared, and went away, and in a while they did not try any more. The weeds grew darker green to protect themselves, and they did not spread any more. The surface of the earth crusted, a thin hard crust, and as the sky became pale, so the earth became pale, pink in the red country and white in the gray country.  In the water-cut gullies the earth dusted down in dry little streams. Gophers and ant lions started small avalanches. And as the sharp sun struck day after day, the leaves of the young corn became less stiff and erect; they bent in a curve at first, and then, as the central ribs of strength grew weak, each leaf tilted downward. Then it was June, and the sun shone more fiercely. The brown lines on the corn leaves widened and moved in on the central ribs. The weeds frayed and edged back toward their roots. The air was thin and the sky more pale; and every day the earth paled. 	30240.0	30240	[0, 3, 2, 1]	VALID	1: This passage describes the arrival of the last rains in Oklahoma, which bring greenery to the landscape. As the weather gets hotter, the plants begin to wilt and the earth becomes pale. 2: The passage describes the arrival of the last rains, which would have taken a day or two. The rest of the passage describes the progression of the weather over the course of several weeks, from the end of May to June. Let's say three weeks have passed.  3: Three weeks have elapsed. At seven days a week that's 21 days. 24 hours in a day, so 504 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 30240 minutes. 4: 30240 minutes. 5: High confidence.
130	SteinJGW.txt|1|u	 In the roads where the teams moved, where the wheels milled the ground and the hooves of the horses beat the ground, the dirt crust broke and the dust formed. Every moving thing lifted the dust into the air: a walking man lifted a thin layer as high as his waist, and a wagon lifted the dust as high as the fence tops, and an automobile boiled a cloud behind it. The dust was long in settling back again.  When June was half gone, the big clouds moved up out of Texas and the Gulf, high heavy clouds, rain-heads. The men in the fields looked up at the clouds and sniffed at them and held wet fingers up to sense the wind. And the horses were nervous while the clouds were up. The rain-heads dropped a little spattering and hurried on to some other country. Behind them the sky was pale again and the sun flared. In the dust there were drop craters where the rain had fallen, and there were clean splashes on the corn, and that was all. 	20160.0	1440	[2, 3, 1, 0]	VALID	1: The passage describes the movement of teams and vehicles on a dirt road, and the dust they kick up. It then describes the arrival of rain clouds in mid-June, which cause anticipation among farmers and nervousness among horses. The clouds drop a little rain but then move on, leaving only small craters and splashes on the ground.  2: The passage describes a series of events that would take place over a few hours or a day at most. The arrival of the rain clouds might suggest that it's been dry for a while, but there's no explicit reference to how long that has been. Let's say the events take place over the course of a day.  3: One day has elapsed. Multiplying by 24 hours in a day and 60 minutes in an hour, that's 1440 minutes.  4: 1440 minutes.  5: High confidence.
131	SteinJGW.txt|6|u	     Chapter 2  A HUGE RED TRANSPORT TRUCK stood in front of the little roadside restaurant. The vertical exhaust pipe muttered softly, and an almost invisible haze of steel-blue smoke hovered over its end. It was a new truck, shining red, and in twelve-inch letters on its sides— OKLAHOMA CITY TRANSPORT COMPANY. Its double tires were new, and a brass padlock stood straight out from the hasp on the big back doors. Inside the screened restaurant a radio played, quiet dance music turned low the way it is when no one is listening. A small outlet fan turned silently in its circular hole over the entrance, and flies buzzed excitedly about the doors and windows, butting the screens. Inside, one man, the truck driver, sat on a stool and rested his elbows on the counter and looked over his coffee at the lean and lonely waitress. He talked the smart listless language of the roadsides to her. “I seen him about three months ago. He had a operation. Cut somepin out. I forget what.'' And she—“Doesn't seem no longer ago than a week I seen him myself. Looked fine then. He's a nice sort of a guy when he ain't stinko.“1 Now and then the flies roared softly at the screen door. The coffee machine spurted steam, and the waitress, without looking, reached behind her and shut it off. 	4.0	2	[1, 3, 2, 0]	VALID	1: A truck is parked outside a roadside restaurant. The truck driver and the waitress talk about someone they both know. Flies buzz around the doors and windows. 2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but the description of the truck and the radio playing suggest that the scene is set in the 1940s or 1950s. The conversation between the truck driver and the waitress is brief, so it probably only takes a few minutes. The description of the flies and the coffee machine suggest that the scene is set in summer, so it might be hot and humid. Let's say the conversation takes two minutes. 3: 2 minutes have elapsed. 4: 2 minutes. 5: High confidence.
132	SteinJGW.txt|11|u	The driver looked over at him, slitting his eyes, and he chewed as though thoughts and impressions were being sorted and arranged by his jaws before they were finally filed away in his brain. His eyes began at the new cap, moved down the new clothes to the new shoes. The hitch-hiker squirmed his back against the seat in comfort, took off his cap, and swabbed his sweating forehead and chin with it. “Thanks, buddy,'' he said. “My dogs was pooped out.''  “New shoes,'' said the driver. His voice had the same quality of secrecy and insinuation his eyes had. “You oughtn' to take no walk in new shoes—hot weather.''  The hiker looked down at the dusty yellow shoes. “Didn't have no other shoes,'' he said. “Guy got to wear 'em if he got no others.''  The driver squinted judiciously ahead and built up the speed of the truck a little. “Goin' far?''  “Uh-uh! I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.''  The questions of the driver had the tone of a subtle examination. He seemed to spread nets, to set traps with his questions. “Lookin' for a job?'' he asked.  “No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a cropper, but we been there a long time.''  The driver looked significantly at the fields along the road where the corn was fallen sideways and the dust was piled on it. Little flints shoved through the dusty soil. The driver said, as though to himself, “A forty-acre cropper and he ain't been dusted out and he ain't been tractored out?''  “ 'Course I ain't heard lately,'' said the hitch-hiker. 	3.0	5	[1, 2, 0, 3]	VALID	1: A hitchhiker gets a ride from a truck driver. The driver scrutinizes the hitchhiker's new clothes and shoes, and asks him questions about his destination and employment.  2: The hitchhiker takes off his cap and wipes his face, which takes a few seconds. The driver looks the hitchhiker up and down, which might take a minute. The driver then asks several questions, which might take a few minutes.  3: Let's say five minutes have elapsed.  4: 5 minutes.  5: High confidence.

And men with hoses squirt kerosene on the oranges, and they are angry at the crime, angry at the people who have come to take the fruit. A million people hungry, needing the fruit—and kerosene sprayed over the golden mountains.  And the smell of rot fills the country.  Burn coffee for fuel in the ships. Burn corn to keep warm, it makes a hot fire. Dump potatoes in the rivers and place guards along the banks to keep the hungry people from fishing them out. Slaughter the pigs1 and bury them, and let the putrescence drip down into the earth.  There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success. The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit.

Edward, the eldest son of Mr. and Mrs. De Clairville, was the darling of his parents, and from his earliest infancy had^given neither a moments uneasiness.

It is unclear how many years passed between these events, but it is likely at least a few years. Let's estimate conservatively and say five years.  3: Five years have elapsed.

They congratulated themselves, that this beloved brother would have no further occasion to pore, so many hours in the day, over the enormous folios of greek and latin he had been accustomed to do in his occasional returns home : He would now have leisure to attend them ia their walks, or rides ; their sedentary pursuits he would also enliven: his books would make their working or painting hours pass swiftly, and in short in every employment or recreation, Edward was a prominent figure.  Matilda the eldest daughter, two years   6 MELCOMBE LODGE.  her brother's senior, had been married some years, and was at this time the mother of a fine boy in his fourth year. Harriet two years younger than Edward, Ellen and Sophia twins, with a younger ion still at school, were the other members of the De Clairville family.

Matilda is married and has a child, while the others are still at home. Sir Charles Rushbrook, Mrs. De Clairville's brother, is also mentioned. 2: The passage describes the family's current situation and does not include any explicit reference to time. However, it does mention that Edward is about to finish his degree, which typically takes three years. It also mentions that Matilda has a four-year-old child, which suggests that at least four years have passed since her marriage. The passage also mentions that Sir Charles Rushbrook is a widower, which implies that some time has passed since his wife's death. Based on these clues, it seems likely that several years have passed since the family's situation was last described. Let's say five years. 3: Five years have elapsed. At 365 days a year that's 1825 days x 24 hours in a day, so 43800 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 2628000 minutes. 4: 2628000 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

The younger brother of Mrs. De Clair vilie, a Post Captain in the Navy, had been so much engaged by his profession, that several years had elapsed since he had seen his sister or Sir Charles.

Sir Charles has withdrawn from politics and enjoys spending time with Emily, whose governess is a woman named Mrs. Sedley. Sir Charles's brother-in-law, Captain Rushbrook, plans to visit soon. 2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but it does mention that Captain Rushbrook hasn't seen his sister or Sir Charles in several years. Let's say that 'several' means at least three years. The passage also mentions that Sir Charles has withdrawn from politics, which suggests that he's been living quietly for some time. Let's say that he's been living quietly for at least a year. Finally, the passage mentions that Mrs. Sedley has been carefully cultivating Emily's understanding and instilling her with excellent principles. This suggests that Emily has been under Mrs. Sedley's care for some time, perhaps a year or more. Let's say that Emily has been under Mrs. Sedley's care for two years.  3: The total time elapsed is at least three years (for Captain Rushbrook's absence) plus one year (for Sir Charles's withdrawal from politics) plus two years (for Emily's time with Mrs. Sedley) equals six years.

The World has been, and daily continue to be convinced of the truth of this assertion, yet so prevalant is this Folly, (I may call it even a Crime,) that either thro' weakness of Judgement, or ill placed Ambition, very near three parts of the World are guilty of it to their own Prejudice, and those whom they are concern'd with.  The following Sheets, contain a genuine Account of an unhappy instance of this kind, and it's fatal consequences, which give me leave to hope may happily prevent any future Ills of this Nature. And tho' Histories are so commonly made the Entertainment of the Publick, that Truth and Falsehood are equally regarded, and past by, by the Reader only as Fabulous, but this Narrative, has a Claim to Reflection, as it Unfortunately happen'd in the Reign of King Charles the First,, and was the ruin of two worthy Families, whose Branches are still in being; one of whom gave me a sufficient Account as give them by Tradition, and are now notwithstanding the length of Time since the dreadful event, unhappy Sufferers, thro' the Indiscretion of their Ancestors. 	26280000.0	5	[2, 1, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The passage is an introduction to a narrative about the dangers of living beyond one's means, and the consequences of doing so.

Her beauty, Merit and Fortune, from fifteen Years of Age, assembled a numerous train of Admirers, but as her heart was not affected by any of them 'till she was above seventeen, her Father would not insist on a Union with any, 'till she had met with the Man she thought she could be truly happy with; rather preferring his Daughter's Peace of Mind than her interest, as he could make a worthy Husband entirely easy in point of Circumstances, whom gratitude as well as Love, wou'd he conceiv'd, compel him to use his Child well not only by the Possession of a blooming Amiable Creature, but receiving an Advantage of Fortune, the want of which, has too often made way for a Fool, while a Man of Sense, has been deprived of  an Opportunity of tenderly making amends for Deficiency. 	9460800.0	10512000	[0, 2, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The passage describes a gentleman named Weston who has one daughter. He wants to make sure she is well-educated and happy before marrying her off. She has many suitors but does not fall in love until she is 17.  2: The passage covers a period of at least 17 years, from the daughter's birth to her falling in love. It's possible that the father's efforts to educate her took longer than that, but we don't have enough information to say. Let's say 20 years. 3: 20 years have elapsed.

Tho' this was a genteel Fortune, 'twas unequal to the young Lady's; whose Father gave her on the Day of Marriage, ten Thousand Pounds in Bank Notes, and at his Death left her ten Thousand more. In a few Weeks after the young couple were married, they open'd a very Grand Shop in the City, and Mr. Dennis placed with his Son as his Foreman one Mr. Arnold an elderly discreet Man, who had serv'd in that  Capacity with young Dennis 's master, who having acquired a Competent Fortune, left off Trade and retir'd into the Country. Mr. Arnold was a worthy Man, who having a very large Family, and meeting with misfortunes in Trade, was in his early Days so so unhappily reduc'd, as to be oblig'd to throw up his Business, that without Scandal or reproach he might do Justice to his Creditors, tho' he himself suffered greatly, from many to whom he had largely intrusted his Goods, for very considerable sums. But as he was a Man of almost unprecedented Principles of honour, he rather chose to lead a life of servitude, than meanly buffet with ill fortune, to support at best a broken Reputation. 	50400.0	129600	[2, 0, 1, 3]	VALID	1: The passage describes the financial arrangements made for a young couple's marriage, including the establishment of a shop and the hiring of a foreman.  2: The passage doesn't give any explicit indication of how much time has passed, but it does describe a series of events that would take some time to arrange: the couple's marriage, the establishment of a shop, and the hiring of a foreman. Let's say these events took a few months to arrange.  3: Let's say three months have elapsed. At 30 days a month that's 90 days. 24 hours in a day, so 2160 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 129600 minutes. 4: 129600 minutes. 5: Low confidence, since the estimate is based on speculation.
164	CharCMO.txt|4|u	Young Dennis receiv'd his instructions in Trade from Mr. Arnold, who tutor'd him in so gentle a Manner, it occasion'd a great Regard and Tenderness on both sides, and gave the good Man such a power over Dennis that he strictly adher'd to what he advised or proposed, and thought himself under a certain  obligation to pay him the Respect due to Father, and was as fearful of Offending the Friendship of the one as of disobeying the Commands of the other. But Alass Time which brings forth all strange and unaccountable things, wrought a fatal change in the disposition of this thoughtless young man, who instead of following the worthy examples of his industrious friend, soon after his kind father had settled him in such a manner, as enabled him in a few years to acquire an immense fortune; he grew tired of business, and too fond of every pleasurable expence that could possibly Conspire to effect his ruin, and destroy his fame; the first step towards his destruction was to set up an equipage, and furnish both his town and country house suitable to the dignity of a man of quality; as the family increased as it did every year by the birth of a child, additional servants were provided, and every needful expence was swell'd into a superfluity. Among the rest of the follies he run into the encouragement of a set of hangers on, who made him their daily bread, was not the least. 	1576800.0	2628000	[2, 3, 1, 0]	VALID	1: The passage describes the downfall of a young man named Dennis, who was initially mentored in trade by Mr. Arnold. Dennis becomes wealthy but grows tired of business and begins to spend recklessly, including on an expensive carriage and servants. He also begins to support a group of hangers-on. 2: The passage describes a few years of Dennis's life, during which he becomes wealthy and then begins to spend recklessly. It's unclear how long it takes for him to acquire his wealth, but it's likely that it takes at least a few years. Let's say that the events in the passage take place over a period of five years. 3: Five years have elapsed. At 365 days a year that's 1825 days x 24 hours in a day, so 43800 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 2628000 minutes. 4: 2628000 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because of the ambiguity about how long it takes for Dennis to acquire his wealth.
165	CharCMO.txt|5|u	 And the only virtue that remained untainted in him, was a tender fondness for his wife and children, which indeed each had an undoubted claim to; the former for her uncommon merit in regard to her husband, and the World in general, the other from their inoffended innocence. Mr. Arnold perceiving his master's growing ruin, took upon him to use the Priveledge of friendship, to warn of the dreadful consequences of persisting in a continuation of this course of life, but he had the mortification to find him cold and unwilling to hear or regard the tender admonitions he frequently made use of. At last Mr. Dennis who was ready dress'd for a journey to his country house one morning, rang the bell, at which summons a youth who was a turn-over Apprentice to him instantly appeared and receiv'd an order from his master for Mr. Arnold to send him up a bill or cash, for fifty pounds, instead of the money Mr. Arnold sent his respects, and that he would wait upon him himself in a few momets, which accordingly he did, carrying  with him his book of accompts, instead of answering the demand made by the apprentice. When Mr. Arnold enter'd the room, Mr. Dennis perceiv'd the marks of real sorrow in his countenance, which shock'd him, but he still endeavour'd to hide it from the other, and demanded the money, upon which Mr. Arnold look'd at him very stedfastly, fetch'd a deep figh, desir'd him to look over those accompts and judge how much reason he had to suppose, that 'twas possible for him to expect such a draught to be answer'd, and after shewing him the accounts which he knew he would himself inspect, he sat down by him, and with an almost broken heart, insisting on his knowing the shameful misery he had reduced himself too, and thus address'd him. 	30240.0	86400	[0, 3, 1, 2]	VALID	1: The passage describes a man's growing ruin and his friend's attempts to warn him. The man sends an apprentice to demand money, but the friend brings his book of accounts instead and shows the man how much he owes.  2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but it does describe a sequence of events that would take some time to unfold. The man's ruin is described as 'growing,' which suggests that it has been happening over a period of time. The friend has made 'frequent' attempts to warn him, which also suggests that some time has passed. The man sends an apprentice to demand money, which implies that he has had time to accumulate debts. All of these factors suggest that the events in the passage have taken place over a period of weeks or months. Let's say two months.  3: Two months have elapsed.

Arnold promises to help Mr. Dennis find an excuse for not going. 2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but it seems likely that the conversation between Mr. Dennis and Mr. Arnold would have taken at least a few minutes.

173	CharCMO.txt|17|u	Old Mr. Dennis was so violently exasperated, he refused the least Assistance towards his Son's Redemption, yet pitied his unhappy Daughter in Law, and behaved very tender towards her and her Children as a fond Father  possibly could, intreating her to go home with him and strongly urged her though 'twas his own Child to endeavour to forget him; but her fondness was too powerful to listen to his Advice, which in the mood the old Gentleman was in, he order'd his Coach and went away highly displeased at his Daughter's refusal of his offer, Mr. Edgeworth, who had a sincere regard for young Dennis, which was greatly strengthened by the inviolate fondness he had for his Sister, kindly and generously resolved to repair his Fortune, by bringing his Creditors to a Composition, or if that failed he resolved to pay his Debts, and give him a Term of Years to make him an Acknowledgment. Miss Harriet took this as the highest proof of his Regard to her, tho' she was sorty he should hazard any part of his Fortune to serve her Relation, and that she wanted no such severe proofs of his Passion for her, for such she term'd it, as it was doubtful whether it would ever be in her Brother's power to make him a suitable return; but these fears did not prevent his generous design, which he put into immediate Execution the moment he got  to Town, and with Mr. Arnold 's assistance, every Creditor was paid to the full extent, the amount of which came to upwards of Fourteen Thousand Pounds. 	17280.0	10080	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: Mr. Dennis refuses to help his son, but is kind to his daughter-in-law and grandchildren. He offers to take the daughter-in-law home with him, but she refuses. Mr. Edgeworth resolves to help young Dennis by paying his debts or arranging a composition with his creditors. He does so with the help of Mr. Arnold, paying over £14,000. 2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the events described would have taken some time to happen. Mr. Edgeworth would have had to travel to town, meet with Mr. Arnold, and arrange payment with each creditor. This would have taken at least a few days, if not a week or more. Let's say one week. 3: One week has elapsed. At seven days a week that's 7 days. 24 hours in a day, so 168 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 10,080 minutes. 4: 10,080 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

As he had attempted his Life, proper care was taken to prevent his destroying himself, and as soon as he was committed to Newgate, a sufficient Guard was set over him on that Account. 	2880.0	60	[2, 1, 0, 3]	VALID	1: A man named Mr. Dennis counts his money and finds receipts for debts paid by his friend. He becomes distraught and tries to shoot himself, but the gun misfires. The landlord comes in and stops him. Within an hour, he is caught and confesses to robbery and murder. He is taken to Newgate prison and guarded to prevent suicide. 2: The passage describes several events that would take some time: counting money, reading receipts, becoming distraught, attempting suicide, being caught, confessing, and being taken to prison. These events could take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours. Let's say the events took an hour. 3: One hour has elapsed. 60 minutes in an hour, so 60 minutes. 4: 60 minutes. 5: High confidence.
175	CharCMO.txt|20|u	Miss Harriet was directly seized with a violent Fever for the loss of an honourable Lover, barbarously depriv'd of Life by the hand of her unhappy Brother, whose shameful  End anticipitated the Decrees of Heaven in regard to both, and in a few days gave a fatal Period to that young Lady, who expir'd in the height of Madness. Mrs. Denais had not so happy a Relief, for she lingered in Anguish and Despair, till the Morning her hapless Spouse was to be executed, during whose Confinement she constantly attended him, contrary to the Commands of his and her own Father, who took the Children down into the Country, that they might not be pointed at as the unhappy Ofsprings of their unfortunate Father; what added to the immoderate Grief of this Inconsolable Creature, was the knowledge of her Husband being Coddemned to be hung in Chains on Account of the Murder. The Night before his Execution she persisted in staying in the Press-Yard, on the outside of the Cell, where her destin'd Husband lay; as soon as he was brought forth in the Morning in order to receive his Fate, with speechless Grief she fell into his Arms, with the tenderest Marks of deep and silent Sorrow;  in this conflict of Despair and Love, expired. 	50400.0	30240	[2, 0, 1, 3]	VALID	1: The passage describes the deaths of two women, Miss Harriet and Mrs. Denais, in the aftermath of violent events.  2: The passage doesn't give any explicit indication of how much time has passed, but it seems likely that the events described would have taken at least a few weeks to unfold. The deaths of both women are described as happening 'in a few days' and 'the night before his execution,' respectively, which suggests that some time has passed since the initial violent events. Let's say three weeks have passed.  3: Three weeks have elapsed. At seven days a week that's 21 days. 24 hours in a day, so 504 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 30240 minutes. 4: 30240 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
176	CharCMO.txt|21|u	This shocking scene drew Tears from each Spectator, and sent the Dying Husband quite delirious to his shameful End. Mr. Arnold, who at his request attended his last Moments, soon after died with Grief: And poor Mr. William the Apprentice who had many Obligations to Mr. Dennis, grew into a settled Melancholly which he never overcame, the Parents of this unhappy Couple lived but few Years after this dreadful Catastrophe, one retire from Business, and the other languish'd out a miserable Life at his country seat, where he denied himself the benefit of Light, from the fatal Hour of his Daughters Death. This Story is too True to be distrusted, or Disregarded by the Reader, or those who may hear it told; and as every Person who breaths may be liable to the same dreadful Misfortune; 'tis not to be deem'd an Offence to relate the sad consequences arising from Ill-plac'd pride, and unreasonable Ambition. The strongest Motive that could possibly induce me to publish this Melancholly, was an Observation I  have made for many Years of the presumptiae Vanity daily increasing and prompting many Persons in Trade to live up to the State of those, whose Birth and Fortune might justifie the running into such Expences, as must naturally terminate in the Ruin of Trading Families, and be the unhappy cause of Multiplying the numerous Indigent, who but for this failing in Parents might live comfortably to themselves and be generally beneficial to the World. FINIS.       	1576800.0	5256000	[0, 2, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The passage describes the aftermath of a tragic event, including the death of several people and the long-term effects on others.  2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but it describes the long-term effects of the event, suggesting that years have passed. Let's say 10 years have passed since the event.  3: 10 years have elapsed.

177	RushSM.txt|0|u	MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN   A Novel      Salman Rushdie   The Perforated Sheet   I WAS BORN in the city of Bombay … once upon a time. No, that won't do, there's no getting away from the date: I was born in Doctor Narlikar's Nursing Home on August 15th, 1947. And the time? The time matters, too. Well then: at night. No, it's important to be more … On the stroke of midnight, as a matter of fact. Clock-hands joined palms in respectful greeting as I came. Oh, spell it out, spell it out: at the precise instant of India's arrival at independence, I tumbled forth into the world. There were gasps. And, outside the window, fireworks and crowds. A few seconds later, my father broke his big toe; but his accident was a mere trifle when set beside what had befallen me in that benighted moment, because thanks to the occult tyrannies of those blandly saluting clocks I had been mysteriously handcuffed to history, my destinies indissolubly chained to those of my country. For the next three decades, there was to be no escape. Soothsayers had prophesied me, newspapers celebrated my arrival, politicos ratified my authenticity. I was left entirely without a say in the matter. I, Saleem Sinai, later variously called Snotnose, Stainface, Baldy, Sniffer, Buddha and even Piece-of-the-Moon, had become heavily embroiled in Fate—at the best of times a dangerous sort of involvement. And I couldn't even wipe my own nose at the time. 	0.2499	10	[3, 1, 0, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator describes his birth in Bombay at midnight on August 15th, 1947, the moment of India's independence. He reflects on the significance of this moment for his life. 2: The passage describes the moment of the narrator's birth, which would have taken only a few minutes. However, the narrator also reflects on the significance of this moment for his life over the next three decades. Let's say this reflection takes an additional 10 minutes. 3: 10 minutes have elapsed. 4: 10 minutes. 5: High confidence.
178	RushSM.txt|1|u	 Now, however, time (having no further use for me) is running out. I will soon be thirty-one years old. Perhaps. If my crumbling, overused body permits. But I have no hope of saving my life, nor can I count on having even a thousand nights and a night. I must work fast, faster than Scheherazade, if I am to end up meaning—yes, meaning—something. I admit it: above all things, I fear absurdity.  And there are so many stories to tell, too many, such an excess of intertwined lives events miracles places rumors, so dense a commingling of the improbable and the mundane! I have been a swallower of lives; and to know me, just the one of me, you'll have to swallow the lot as well. Consumed multitudes are jostling and shoving inside me; and guided only by the memory of a large white bedsheet with a roughly circular hole some seven inches in diameter cut into the center, clutching at the dream of that holey, mutilated square of linen, which is my talisman, my open-sesame, I must commence the business of remaking my life from the point at which it really began, some thirty-two years before anything as obvious, as present, as my clock-ridden, crime-stained birth. 	16819200.0	0	[2, 1, 3, 0]	CALC ERROR	1: The narrator reflects on his age and the limited time he has left to tell his stories. He expresses a fear of absurdity and a sense of being overwhelmed by the many stories he has to tell. He describes himself as a 'swallower of lives' and suggests that he will need to tell many stories to convey his own. He then refers to a 'large white bedsheet with a roughly circular hole some seven inches in diameter cut into the center' as a talisman that will help him begin the process of remaking his life. 2: The passage is mostly reflective and doesn't describe any specific events, but the narrator does mention that he will soon be thirty-one years old and that he fears he doesn't have much time left. He also suggests that he has many stories to tell and that he will need to work quickly to tell them all. It's unclear how much time has passed since the narrator was born, but he does mention that he will need to 'commence the business of remaking my life from the point at which it really began, some thirty-two years before anything as obvious, as present, as my clock-ridden, crime-stained birth.' This suggests that the narrator is at least thirty-two years old, and possibly older. Given the reflective nature of the passage, it's difficult to estimate how much time has elapsed. 3: It's difficult to estimate how much time has elapsed, so there is no range to take the midpoint of. 4: N/A 5: High confidence that it's difficult to estimate how much time has elapsed.

You said: certain foreign women come here to drown.”  “I, Sahib?” Tai shocked, malodorous, innocent. “But grief is making your head play trick! How can I know these things?”  And after the body, bloated, wrapped in weeds, had been dredged up by a group of blank-faced boatmen, Tai visited the shikara halt and told the men there, as they recoiled from his breath of a bullock with dysentery, “He blames me, only imagine! Brings his loose Europeans here and tells me it is my fault when they jump into the lake! … I ask, how did he know just where to look? Yes, ask him that, ask that nakkoo Aziz!”  She had left a note. It read: “I didn't mean it.”  I make no comment; these events, which have tumbled from my lips any old how, garbled by haste and emotion, are for others to judge. Let me be direct now, and say that during the long, hard winter of 1918-19, Tai fell ill, contracting a violent skin disease, akin to that European curse called the King's Evil; but he refused to see Doctor Aziz, and was treated by a local homeopath.	5.0	0	[2, 0, 1, 3]	CALC ERROR	1: The passage describes a conversation between Doctor Aziz and Tai, in which Tai denies knowing anything about foreign women drowning in a lake. Later, a body is found in the lake, and Tai blames Doctor Aziz for bringing 'loose Europeans' to the lake. The passage ends by noting that Tai fell ill with a skin disease during the winter of 1918-19 and refused to see Doctor Aziz. 2: The passage doesn't give any explicit indication of how much time has passed, but it seems likely that some time has elapsed between the conversation about the foreign women and the discovery of the body. It's also unclear how much time passes between the discovery of the body and Tai falling ill. Given the lack of information, it's difficult to estimate how much time has elapsed. 3: N/A 4: N/A 5: High certainty about the lack of information.

On June 4th, my ill-matched parents left for Bombay by Frontier Mail. (There were hangings, voices hanging on for dear life, fists crying out, “Maharaj! Open for one tick only! Ohé, from the milk of your kindness, great sir, do us favor!” And there was also—hidden beneath dowry in a green tin trunk—a forbidden, lapis-lazuli-encrusted, delicately-wrought silver spittoon.) On the same day, Earl Mountbatten of Burma held a press conference at which he announced the Partition of India, and hung his countdown calendar on the wall: seventy days to go to the transfer of power … sixty-nine … sixty-eight … tick, tock. 	1440.0	1440	[0, 1, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The passage describes Ahmed's memory of a vulture dropping a hand, while Amina ticks herself off. The passage then jumps to June 4th, when the narrator's parents left for Bombay and Earl Mountbatten announced the Partition of India. 2: The events described in Ahmed's memory and Amina's ticking probably take only a few seconds. The events of June 4th, however, include a press conference and a train journey, and so must take at least a day.  3: Let's say one day has elapsed. At 24 hours in a day, that's 1440 minutes. 4: 1440 minutes. 5: High confidence.

Revealed: the deception which had tricked an accordionist's wife. Samson-like, William Methwold's power had resided in his hair; but now, bald patch glowing in the dusk, he flings his thatch through the window of his motor-car; distributes, with what looks like carelessness, the signed title-deeds to his palaces; and drives away. Nobody at Methwold's Estate ever saw him again; but I, who never saw him once, find him impossible to forget.  Suddenly everything is saffron and green. Amina Sinai in a room with saffron walls and green woodwork. In a neighboring room, Wee Willie Winkie's Vanita, green-skinned, the whites of her eyes shot with saffron, the baby finally beginning its descent through inner passages that are also, no doubt, similarly colorful. Saffron minutes and green seconds tick away on the clocks on the walls. Outside Doctor Narlikar's Nursing Home, there are fireworks and crowds, also conforming to the colors of the night—saffron rockets, green sparkling rain; the men in shirts of zafaran hue, the women in saris of lime.	5.0	10	[1, 0, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The passage describes a man, Mr. Methwold, removing his hairpiece and revealing himself to be bald. He then distributes title-deeds and drives away, never to be seen again. The passage then shifts to describing colorful scenes in a nursing home and outside it. 2: The events of Mr. Methwold removing his hairpiece and driving away might take a few minutes. The shift to the nursing home and the fireworks outside it might take a few more minutes. Let's say 10 minutes in total. 3: 10 minutes have elapsed. 4: 10 minutes. 5: High confidence.
182	RushSM.txt|382|u	Ever since I lay hidden in a washing-chest and heard two scandalous syllables, I had been suspecting my mother of secrets; my incursions into her thought processes had confirmed my suspicions; so it was with a hard glint in my eye, and a steely determination, that I visited Sonny Ibrahim one afternoon after school, with the intention of enlisting his help.  I found Sonny in his room, surrounded by posters of Spanish bullfights, morosely playing Indoor Cricket by himself. When he saw me he cried unhappily, “Hey man I'm damn sorry about Evie man she won't listen to anyone man what the hell'd you do to her anyway?” … But I held up a dignified hand, commanding and being accorded silence.  “No time for that now, man,” I said. “The thing is, I need to know how to open locks without keys.”  A true fact about Sonny Ibrahim: despite all his bullfighting dreams, his genius lay in the realm of mechanical things. For some time now, he had taken on the job of maintaining all the bikes on Methwold's Estate in return for gifts of comic-books and a free supply of fizzy drinks. Even Evelyn Lilith Burns gave her beloved Indiabike into his care. All machines, it seemed, were won over by the innocent delight with which he caressed their moving parts; no contraption could resist his ministrations. To put it another way: Sonny Ibrahim had become (out of a spirit of pure inquiry) an expert at picking locks. 	120960.0	15	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator visits Sonny Ibrahim to ask him how to pick locks. Sonny is initially distracted by a girl named Evie, but the narrator cuts him off and explains his request. The passage ends with a description of Sonny's mechanical aptitude. 2: The events described in the passage are brief and take place in a single location. The narrator visits Sonny after school, so it's likely that only a few hours have passed since the end of the school day. The conversation between the narrator and Sonny is brief, but it's possible that they talked for up to 30 minutes.  3: Let's say that 15 minutes have elapsed. 4: 15 minutes. 5: High confidence.

I left the movie before the end, to slip back into the boot of the unpolished unwatched Rover, wishing I hadn't gone to see it, unable to resist wanting to watch it all over again.  What I saw at the very end: my mother's hands raising a half-empty glass of Lovely Lassi; my mother's lips pressing gently, nostalgically against the mottled glass; my mother's hands handing the glass to her Nadir-Qasim; who also applied, to the opposite side of the glass, his own, poetic mouth. So it was that life imitated bad art, and my uncle Hanif's sister brought the eroticism of the indirect kiss into the green neon dinginess of the Pioneer Café. 	120.0	180	[3, 1, 2, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator watches a movie in which two people dance around each other without touching, then leaves before the end. The passage ends with a description of the narrator's mother and her partner sharing a drink.  2: The events in the movie take up most of the passage, but it's unclear how long the movie is. Let's say it's a feature-length film, so two hours. The narrator also spends some time traveling to and from the cinema, and some time reflecting on what they've seen. Let's say that takes another hour.  3: Three hours have elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour, that's 180 minutes. 4: 180 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

And one day, amongst the card-players, I recognized the sunken-eyed, ascetic form of Mr. Homi Catrack. Who greeted me with embarrassed heartiness: “Hi there, young chap! Doing fine? Of course, of course you are!”  My uncle Hanif played rummy dedicatedly; but he was in the thrall of a curious obsession—namely, that he was determined never to lay down a hand until he completed a thirteen-card sequence in hearts. Always hearts; all the hearts, and nothing but the hearts would do. In his quest for this unattainable perfection, my uncle would discard perfectly good threes-of-a-kind, and whole sequences of spades clubs diamonds, to the raucous amusement of his friends. I heard the renowned shehnai-player Ustad Changez Khan (who dyed his hair, so that on hot evenings the tops of his ears were discolored by running black fluid) tell my uncle; “Come on, mister; leave this heart business, and just play like the rest of us fellows.” My uncle confronted temptation; then boomed above the din, “No, dammit, go to the devil and leave me to my game!” He played cards like a fool; but I, who had never seen such singleness of purpose, felt like clapping. 	40320.0	5	[0, 2, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator stands on a balcony with Mary Pereira, observing the sights and sounds of Marine Drive. They see card-players, including the narrator's uncle, who is obsessed with completing a thirteen-card sequence in hearts.  2: The passage describes a scene of observation and reflection, which would take a few minutes. The uncle's obsession with hearts seems to be ongoing, but there's no indication of how long he's been playing this way. Let's say the observation and reflection took five minutes.  3: Five minutes have elapsed. 4: 5 minutes. 5: High confidence.
185	RushSM.txt|560|u	 There was a new brilliance about my parents in those days; Amina had lost her guilt-fog, her verrucas seemed not to be playing up any more; while Ahmed, although still whitened, had felt the freeze of his loins thawing under the heat of his newfound love for his wife. On some mornings, Amina had toothmarks on her neck; she giggled uncontrollably at times, like a schoolgirl. “You two, honestly,” her sister Alia said, “Like honeymooners or I don't know what.” But I could smell what was hidden behind Alia's teeth; what stayed inside when the friendly words came out … Ahmed Sinai named his towels after his wife: Amina Brand.  “Who are these multi-multis? These Dawoods, Saigols, Haroons?” he cried gaily, dismissing the richest families in the land. “Who are Valikas or Zulfikars? I could eat them ten at a time. You wait!”, he promised, “In two years the whole world will be wiping itself on an Amina Brand cloth. The finest terry-cloth! The most modern machines! We shall make the whole world clean and dry; Dawoods and Zulfikars will beg to know my secret; and I will say, yes, the towels are high-quality; but the secret is not in the manufacturing; it was love that conquered all.” (I discerned, in my father's speech, the lingering effects of the optimism virus.)  Did Amina Brand conquer the world in the name of cleanliness (which is next to …)? Did Valikas and Saigols come to ask Ahmed Sinai, “God, we're stumped, yaar, how'd you do it?” Did high-quality terry-cloth, in patterns devised by Ahmed himself—a little gaudy, but never mind, they were born of love—wipe away the moistness of Pakistanis and export-markets alike? Did Russians Englishmen Americans wrap themselves in my mother's immortalized name? … The story of Amina Brand must wait awhile; because the career of Jamila Singer is about to take off; the mosque-shadowed house on Clayton Road has been visited by Uncle Puffs. 	80640.0	86400	[2, 1, 0, 3]	VALID	1: The passage describes a period of time when the narrator's parents are newly in love and Amina's husband Ahmed is starting a towel business.  2: There are no explicit references to time, but the passage describes a number of events that would take some time: Amina's verrucas clearing up, Ahmed's loins thawing, Amina and Ahmed's relationship developing, Ahmed starting a business, and the narrator's father's speech. Let's say these events take place over the course of a few weeks to a few months.  3: Let's say two months have elapsed. At 30 days a month that's 60 days. 24 hours in a day, so 1440 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 86400 minutes. 4: 86400 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

Morarji Desai, the Finance Minister, and Jagjivan Ram, most powerful of the untouchables, united in their determination to prevent the establishment of a Nehru dynasty; so Indira Gandhi was denied the leadership. The new Prime Minister was Lal Bahadur Shastri, another member of that generation of politicians who seemed to have been pickled in immortality; in the case of Shastri, however, this was only maya, illusion. Nehru and Shastri have both fully proved their mortality; but there are still plenty of the others left, clutching Time in their mummified fingers and refusing to let it move … in Pakistan, however, the clocks ticked and tocked.  Reverend Mother did not overtly approve of my sister's career; it smacked too much of film-stardom. “My family, whatsitsname,” she sighed to Pia mumani, “is even less controllable than the price of gas.” Secretly, however, she may have been impressed, because she respected power and position and Jamila was now so exalted as to be welcome in the most powerful and best-placed houses in the land … my grandmother settled in Rawalpindi; however, with a strange show of independence, she chose not to live in the house of General Zulfikar. She and my aunt Pia moved into a modest bungalow in the old part of town; and by pooling their savings, purchased a concession on the long-dreamed-of petrol pump. 	262800.0	10080	[1, 0, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The passage describes the arrival of the narrator's grandmother in Pakistan in mid-1964, and then shifts to a discussion of the narrator's sister's career and the Reverend Mother's opinion of it.

O smacking of lips at the sight of the title NEXT ATTRACTION, superimposed on undulating blue velvet! O anticipatory salivation before screens trumpeting COMING SOON!—Because the promise of exotic futures has always seemed, to my mind, the perfect antidote to the disappointments of the present.) “Stop, stop,” I exhort my mournfully squatting audience, “I'm not finished yet! There is to be electrocution and a rain-forest; a pyramid of heads on a field impregnated by leaky marrowbones; narrow escapes are coming, and a minaret that screamed! Padma, there is still plenty worth telling: my further trials, in the basket of invisibility and in the shadow of another mosque; wait for the premonitions of Resham Bibi and the pout of Parvati-the-witch! Fatherhood and treason also, and of course that unavoidable Widow, who added to my history of drainage-above the final ignominy of voiding-below … in short, there are still next-attractions and coming-soons galore; a chapter ends when one's parents die, but a new kind of chapter also begins.”  Somewhat consoled by my offers of novelty, my Padma sniffs; wipes away mollusc-slime, dries eyes; breathes in deeply … and, for the spitton-brained fellow we last met in his hospital bed, approximately five years pass before my dung-lotus exhales. 	2.0	2628000	[0, 2, 1, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator tries to console Padma by describing the exciting events that will happen in the future, and Padma cries. Then, five years pass before the narrator's dung-lotus exhales. 2: The narrator's description of future events is probably only a few minutes long. The passage then jumps five years into the future.  3: The midpoint of a range from 2 to 8 minutes is 5 minutes. Five years is 1825 days x 24 hours in a day, so 43800 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 2628000 minutes.  4: 2628000 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because of the ambiguity of the phrase 'Somewhat consoled by my offers of novelty, my Padma sniffs; wipes away mollusc-slime, dries eyes; breathes in deeply … and, for the spitton-brained fellow we last met in his hospital bed, approximately five years pass before my dung-lotus exhales.'
188	RushSM.txt|646|u	 But there is still the meaningless chase, the enemy who will never be seen, and the buddha, “Go that way,” and four of them row on, south south south, they have murdered the hours and forgotten the date, they no longer know if they are chasing after or running from, but whichever it is that pushes them is bringing them closer closer to the impossible green wall, “That way,” the buddha insists, and then they are inside it, the jungle which is so thick that history has hardly ever found the way in. The Sundarbans: it swallows them up.      In the Sundarbans   I'LL OWN UP: there was no last, elusive quarry, driving us south south south. To all my readers, I should like to make this naked-breasted admission: while Ayooba Shaheed Farooq were unable to distinguish between chasing-after and running-from, the buddha knew what he was doing. Although I'm well aware that I am providing any future commentators or venom-quilled critics (to whom I say: twice before, I've been subjected to snake-poison; on both occasions, I proved stronger than venenes) with yet more ammunition—through admission-of-guilt, revelation-of-moral-turpitude, proof-of-cowardice—I'm bound to say that he, the buddha, finally incapable of continuing in the submissive performance of his duty, took to his heels and fled. Infected by the soul-chewing maggots of pessimism futility shame, he deserted, into the historyless anonymity of rain-forests, dragging three children in his wake. What I hope to immortalize in pickles as well as words: that condition of the spirit in which the consequences of acceptance could not be denied, in which an overdose of reality gave birth to a miasmic longing for flight into the safety of dreams … But the jungle, like all refuges, was entirely other—was both less and more—than he had expected. 	0	120	[3, 0, 1, 2]	VALID	1: The passage describes a group of people rowing through the Sundarbans jungle, chasing an elusive quarry. They eventually enter the jungle and the narrator admits that there was no quarry, and that the buddha leading them fled with three children. 2: The passage is ambiguous about how long the group was rowing before entering the jungle. However, the description of the jungle as 'historyless' and 'entirely other' suggests that they were in the jungle for a significant amount of time. Let's say they were rowing for an hour before entering the jungle, and then spent another hour in the jungle before the buddha fled.  3: Two hours have elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour, that's 120 minutes. 4: 120 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

Saleem, today, is certain that he answered, “Yes”; that on the selfsame morning, still dressed in shapeless robe, still inseparable from a silver spittoon, he walked away, without looking back at a girl who followed him with eyes moistened with accusations; that, strolling hastily past practising jugglers and sweetmeat-stalls which filled his nostrils with the temptations of rasgullas, past barbers offering shaves for ten paisa, past the derelict maunderings of crones and the American-accented caterwauls of shoe-shine boys who importuned bus-loads of Japanese tourists in identical blue suits and incongruous saffron turbans which had been tied around their heads by obsequiously mischievous guides, past the towering flight of stairs to the Friday Mosque, past vendors of notions and itr-essences and plaster-of-Paris replicas of the Qutb Minar and painted toy horses and fluttering unslaughtered chickens, past invitations to cockfights and empty-eyed games of cards, he emerged from the ghetto of the illusionists and found himself on Faiz Bazar, facing the infinitely-extending walls of a Red Fort from whose ramparts a prime minister had once announced independence, and in whose shadow a woman had been met by a peepshow-merchant, a Dilli-dekho man who had taken her into narrowing lanes to hear her son's future foretold amongst mongeese and vultures and broken men with leaves bandaged around their arms; that, to be brief, he turned to his right and walked away from the Old City towards the roseate palaces built by pink-skinned conquerors long ago: abandoning my saviors, I went into New Delhi on foot. 	10.0	30	[0, 2, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator is asked if he will leave soon, and he answers in the affirmative. He then walks through a crowded market and out of the Old City towards New Delhi. 2: The passage describes a walk through a crowded market and out of the Old City. This could take anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour, depending on how far he walked. There is no explicit reference to time, but the level of detail suggests that the walk took at least 20 minutes. 3: Let's say the walk took 30 minutes. 4: 30 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

In one world, captains, there is no room for two Most Charming Men.”  The vendor of betel-nut delicacies, shrugging delicately, expectorated at our feet.  Like a magic spell, the taunts of a paan-wallah opened the door through which Saleem returned to the city of his birth, the abode of his deepest nostalgia.	1.0	10080	[1, 0, 2, 3]	VALID	1: Picture Singh learns of a rival performer in Bombay and threatens a paan-wallah to learn more. He decides to go to Bombay to prove himself. The passage ends with a reference to Saleem's return to his birthplace. 2: There is no explicit reference to time, but Picture Singh's decision to go to Bombay implies that he has time to travel there and perform. Let's say that he would need at least a week to travel to Bombay, prepare for a performance, and perform.  3: One week has elapsed. At seven days a week that's 7 days. 24 hours in a day, so 168 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 10080 minutes. 4: 10080 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

In giving to the world the record of what, considered as an  adventure only, is I suppose one of the most wonderful and  mysterious experiences ever undergone by mortal men, I feel  it incumbent on me to explain my exact connexion with it.  So I will say at once that I am not the narrator but only the  editor of this extraordinary history, and then go on to tell  how it found its way into my hands.  Some years ago I, the editor, was stopping with a friend,  'vir doctissimus et amicus mens, ' at a certain University,  which for the purposes of this history we will call Cambridge,  and one day was impressed with the appearance of two  persons whom I saw walking arm in arm down the street.  One of these gentlemen was, I think without exception, the  handsomest young fellow I have ever seen. He was very  tall, very broad, and had a look of power and a grace of bearing  that seemed as native to him as to a wild stag. In addition  his face was almost without flaw — a good face as well as  a beautiful one, and when he lifted his hat, which he did just  then to a passing lady, I saw that his head was covered with  little golden curls growing close to the scalp.	2102400.0	2	[0, 3, 1, 2]	VALID	1: The editor of the story explains that they are not the narrator, but rather the editor of an extraordinary history. They describe seeing two people walking down the street, one of whom was very handsome. 2: The events described in the passage are very brief, likely taking only a few minutes at most. 3: Let's say two minutes have elapsed. 4: 2 minutes. 5: High confidence.

But look at the other one; he is Vincey's (that's  the god's name) guardian, and supposed to be full of every  B  <pb> 2  Site  kind of information. They call him ' Charon, ' either  because of his forbidding appearance or because he has ferried  his ward across the deep waters of examination — I don't know  which.'  I looked, and found the older man quite as interesting in  his way as the glorified specimen of humanity at his side.  He appeared to be about forty years of age, and I think was  as ugly as his companion was handsome. To begin with, he  was short, rather bow legged, very deep chested, and with  unusually long arms. He had dark hair and small eyes, and  the hair grew down on his forehead, and his whiskers grew  quite up to his hair, so that there was uncommonly little of  his countenance to be seen. Altogether he reminded me  forcibly of a gorilla, and yet there was something very  pleasing and genial about the man's eye. I remember saying  that I should like to know him.	1.0	2	[1, 0, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator and a friend are walking and see two men, one of whom is very handsome and the other of whom is ugly but has a genial eye.  2: The events described are brief and take only a few seconds. However, the narrator reflects on the appearance of the two men and makes a comment about wanting to know the ugly one.

He placed the box upon the table, and then fell  into an awful fit of coughing. He coughed and coughed till  his face became quite purple, and at last he sank into a chair  and began to spit up blood. I poured out some whisky into  a tumbler, and gave it to him.

Nor did quarrels arise out of it, at least among  the men, who, when their wives deserted them in favour of a  rival, accepted the matter much as we accept the income  tax or our marriage laws, as something not to be disputed,  and as tending to the good of the community, however  disagreeable they may prove to the individual in particular  instances.  It is very curious to observe how the customs of mankind  on this question vary in different countries, making morality  an affair of latitude and religion, and what is right in one  place wrong and improper in another. It must, however, be  understood that, since all civilised nations appear to accept  it as an axiom that ceremony is the touchstone of morals,  there is, even according to our canons, nothing immoral about  this Amahagger custom, since the public interchange of an  embrace answers to our ceremony of marriage, which, as we  know, justifies most things.  <pb> VII.

However, the events described would have taken some time to occur, including the kissing coram populo and the subsequent conversation and movement into the cave. Let's estimate this at 10-15 minutes. 3: 12.5 minutes have elapsed. Multiplying by 60 minutes in an hour, that's 750 minutes. 4: 750 minutes. 5: Low confidence, as the estimate is based on speculation about the time required for events that are not described in detail.

On the open space between us and the fire lay  a large wooden tray, with four short handles to it, exactly like  a butcher's tray, only not hollowed out. By the side of the  tray was a great pair of long handled iron pincers, and on the  other side of the fire was a similar pair. Somehow I did not  at all like the appearance of this tray and of the accompanying  pincers. There I sat contemplating them and the silent  circle of the fierce moody faces of the men, reflecting that it  was all very awful, and that we were absolutely in the power  of this fearsome people, who, to me at any rate, were all the  more formidable because their true^character was still very  much of a mystery to us. They might be better than I  thought them, or they might be worse. I feared that they  were worse, and I was not wrong. It was a curious sort of a  feast, I reflected, in appearance indeed an entertainment of the  Barmecide stamp, for there was absolutely nothing to eat.	60.0	4200	[2, 1, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator describes sitting in silence with a group of people for an hour, staring at a fire and shadows. The group is in the power of a fearsome people, and the narrator reflects on the mystery of their true character.  2: The passage describes an hour of silence, plus some time for the narrator to reflect on the situation. Let's say 10 minutes for reflection.  3: 70 minutes have elapsed. Multiplying by 60 minutes an hour that's 4200 minutes. 4: 4200 minutes. 5: High confidence.

These two men with the pincers heaved simultaneously,  and, scattering the fire this way and that upon the  rocky floor, lifted from it a large earthenware pot, heated to a  white glow. In an instant, almost with a single movement,  they had reached the spot where Mohammed was struggling.	1.0	0.5	[0, 3, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The passage describes a scene in which a group of people are preparing to cook meat in a pot.

Anything more grand  and imposing than the sight presented by this great natural  castle, starting in solitary grandeur from the level of the plain,  I never saw, and I suppose I never shall. Its very solitude  added to its majesty, and its towering cliffs seemed to kiss the  sky.

I looked, and saw what appeared to be the line of roadway  running straight towards the base of the mountain, though it  was covered with turf. There were high banks on each side  of it, broken here and there, but fairly continuous on the  whole, the meaning of which I did not understand. It seemed  so very odd that anybody should embank a roadway.	5.0	5	[0, 3, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator describes a mountain of volcanic origin, which is round and enormous, covering at least fifty square miles of ground. The narrator admires the sight of the mountain, which is grand and imposing, and sits up in a hammock to gaze at it. Billali, who is with the narrator, points out a path leading towards the base of the mountain, which is covered with turf and has high banks on each side. 2: The events described in the passage are mostly observations and reflections, which would take only a few minutes.

But at length she seemed to wear herself out and ceased.  She sat herself down upon the rocky floor, shaking the dense  cloud of beautiful hair over her face and breast, and began to  sob terribly in the torture of a heartrending despair.

She moans about having lived for two thousand years with her passion and sin eating at her heart.  2: There is no explicit reference to time, but Ayesha's speech suggests that she has been alive for two thousand years. The passage also describes her as having waited for two thousand years. It's unclear whether this waiting is continuous or intermittent, but let's say that it's continuous. Ayesha's speech and actions might take a few minutes, but let's say that they take longer, since she is described as sobbing terribly.

'  ' Nay, I know not, ' I answered; whereon she crossed to  the left hand side of the cave (looking towards the entrance)  and signed to the mutes to hold up the lamps. On the wall  was something painted with a red pigment in similar characters  to those hewn beneath the sculpture of Tisno, King of K6r.  This long inscription Ayesha translated to me, the pigment  still being quite fresh enough to show the form of the letters.  It ran as follows: —  ' I, Junis, a priest of the Great Temple of K6r, write this  upon the rock of the burying place in the year four thousand  eight hundred and three from the founding of K6r.

Ayesha shows the narrator a painting on the wall with an inscription that she translates. The inscription is about the fall of the city of Kor. 2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage. However, the events described would have taken at least a few minutes, given the need to walk to the center of the cave, stop at a specific spot, and examine a painting on the wall.

Anything more  appalling than this jumbled mass of the remains of a departed  race I cannot imagine, and what made it even more dreadful  was that in this dry air a considerable number of the bodies  had become desiccated with the skin still on them, and now,  1 The name of the tribe, ' ama hagger, ' would seem to indicate a curious  mingling of races such as might easily have occurred in the neighbourhood  of the Zambesi. The prefix ' Ama' is common to the Zulu and  kindred races, and signifies ' people, ' while ' hagger ' is an Arabic word  meaning a stone. — Editor.  <pb> The Tombs of Kor  179  fixed in every conceivable position, stared at us out of the  mountain of white bones, grotesquely horrible caricatures  of humanity. In my astonishment I uttered an ejaculation,  and the echoes of my voice, ringing in that vaulted space,  disturbed a skull which had been accurately balanced for  many thousands of years near the apex of the pile. Down it  came with a run, bounding along merrily towards us, and of  course bringing an avalanche of other bones after it, till at  last the whole pit rattled with their movement, even as though  the skeletons were rising up to greet us.	2.0	10	[0, 2, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator describes a scene in which he sees a vast pile of human skeletons in a charnel house in London. He is horrified by the sight, and describes how some of the bodies have become desiccated and are still wearing skin. He accidentally disturbs the pile, causing a skull to fall and set off an avalanche of bones. 2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but the narrator's description of the scene is quite detailed and suggests that he spent some time observing and reflecting on what he saw. Let's say he spent 10 minutes in the charnel house. 3: 10 minutes. 4: 10 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

As it chanced, however,  <pb> Go, Woman!' 207  he was merely curious, and also, like myself, somewhat  awed, for, though no hint had been given to him by She  of her extraordinary age, not unnaturally he came to identify  her with the woman spoken of on the potsherd. At last, quite  driven into a corner by his continual questions, which he  showered on me while be was dressing on this third morning,  I referred him to Ayesha, saying, with perfect truth; that I  did not know where Ustane was. Accordingly, after Leo had  eaten a hearty breakfast, we adjourned into She's presence,  for her mutes had orders to admit us at all hours.	120.0	10080	[0, 3, 1, 2]	VALID	1: The passage describes a young man who is still recovering from an illness and is curious about a woman named Ayesha. He and the narrator go to meet Ayesha after the young man asks too many questions about Ustane. 2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the young man is still recovering from an illness, which could take several weeks or even months. Additionally, the narrator mentions that the young man has been asking him questions for three mornings, which suggests that at least three days have passed. Let's estimate that a week has passed. 3: One week has elapsed. At seven days a week that's 7 days. 24 hours in a day, so 168 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 10080 minutes. 4: 10080 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

Of course we rose ai once, and started. And here again  my pen fails me.

Court upon dim court, row upon row of mighty pillars — some  of them, especially at the gateways, sculptured from base  to capital — space upon space of empty chambers that spoke  more eloquently to the imagination than any crowded streets.	60.0	10	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator and a woman named Atene are eating and discussing the narrator's visit to the ruined city of Kor. Atene invites the narrator to see the full moon shining over the ruins and to visit the temple there. They go to the temple, which is described as magnificent even in its ruined state. 2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time. However, the events described would have taken some time, even if it's just a few minutes to finish eating and then walk to the temple. Let's say 10 minutes. 3: 10 minutes have elapsed. 4: 10 minutes. 5: High confidence.

Then a great fury filled me, making me mad, and I  seized the javelin that thou didst bear, and stabbed thee,  so that, at my feet, in the very place of Life, thou didst  groan and go down into death. I knew not then that I had  strength to slay with mine eyes and by the power of my will,  therefore in my madness I slew with the javelin  ' And when thou wast dead, ah !

Let's say this takes a minute or two.  3: 1.5 minutes have elapsed. Multiplying by 60 seconds in a minute, that's 90 seconds. 4: 90 seconds. 5: High confidence.

As we went, however, I  took the precaution of noting our route as well as I could;  and this was not so very difficult, owing to the extraordinary  and most fantastic shapes of the rocks that were strewn about,  many of which in that dim light looked more like the  grim faces carven upon mediaeval gargoyles than ordinary  boulders.  For a considerable time we travelled on thus, half an hour  I should say, till, after we had descended many hundreds of  <pb> The Spirit of Life  279  feet, I perceived that we had reached the point of the inverted  cone, where, at the very apex of the funnel, we found a  passage, so low and narrow that we were forced to stoop as  we crept along it. After some fifty yards of this creeping the  passage suddenly widened into a cave, so huge that we could  see neither the roof nor the sides. Indeed, we only knew  that it was a cave by the echo of our tread and the perfect  quiet of the heavy air.	30.0	30	[1, 0, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator and others climb down a steep slope into a volcano, taking note of the route. They travel for about half an hour before reaching a narrow passage that leads to a large cave. 2: The passage describes the group traveling for about half an hour, so that's our estimate. 3: 30 minutes. 4: 30 minutes. 5: High confidence.
207	haggardshe.txt|509|u	Suffice it to say that, after incredible hardships and privations, we did reach the Zambesi, which proved to be about a hundred and seventy miles south of the spot where Billali left us. There for six months we were imprisoned by a savage tribe, who believed us to be supernatural beings, chiefly on account of Leo's youthful face and snow-white hair. From these people we escaped, and, crossing the Zambesi, wandered southwards, where, when on the point of starvation, we were sufficiently fortunate to fall in with a half caste Portuguese hunter who had followed a troop of elephants farther inland than he had ever been before. This man treated us most hospitably, and, after innumerable sufferings and adventures, ultimately, through his assistance, we reached Delagoa Bay, more than eighteen months from the time when we emerged from the marshes of Kor, and on the next day were so fortunate as to catch one of the steamboats that trade round the Cape to England. Our journey home was prosperous, and we set foot on the quay at Southampton exactly two years from the date of our departure upon our wild and seemingly ridiculous quest. Now I write these last words with Leo leaning over my shoulder in the old room in my college,the same into which some two and twenty years ago my poor friend Vincey stumbled on the memorable night of his death, bearing with him the iron chest.	1008000.0	799200	[2, 3, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator describes a journey that took them 18 months to reach Delagoa Bay, and then another six months to return to England. They are now writing in a college room with someone named Leo looking over their shoulder. 2: The passage explicitly states that the journey took 18 months to reach Delagoa Bay and six months to return to England. There is no indication of how long they have been in the college room, but it is likely a short period of time. Let's say 10 minutes. 3: 18.5 months have elapsed. At 30 days a month that's 555 days x 24 hours in a day, so 13320 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 799200 minutes. 4: 799200 minutes. 5: High confidence.
208	haggardshe.txt|510|u	 Here ends this history so far as it concerns science  and the outside world. What its end will be as regards  Leo and myself is more than I can guess. But we feel that  is not reached yet. A story that began more than two  thousand years ago may stretch a long way into the dim and  distant future.  Is Leo really a reincarnation of that ancient Kallikrates  of whom the inscription tells ? Or was Ayesha deceived by  some strange hereditary resemblance ? And, another question  : In this play of reincarnations, had Ustane aught to  do with the Amenartas of long ago ? The reader must form  his own opinion on these as on many other matters. I have  mine, which is that, as regards Leo, She made no mistake.  Often I sit alone at night, staring with the eyes of my  mind into the blackness of unborn time, and wondering in  what shape and form the great drama will be finally developed,  and where the scene of its next act will be laid. And when,  ultimately, that final development occurs, as I have no doubt  it must and will occur, in obedience to a fate that never  swerves and a purpose which cannot be altered, what will be  the part played therein by that beautiful Egyptian Amenartas,  the Princess of the royal race of the Pharaohs, for the love  of whom the Priest Kallikrates broke his vows to Isis, and,  pursued by the inexorable vengeance of the outraged Goddess,  fled down the coast of Libya to meet his doom at Kor ?	2628000.0	10	[0, 1, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The passage is a reflection on the end of a story, and the author's musings on what might happen next. 2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but the author is reflecting on the story that has just been told. Let's say that the author takes at least 10 minutes to write this reflection. 3: 10 minutes. 4: 10 minutes. 5: High confidence.
209	FrosMT.txt|0|u	  AN ENVELOPE     THE ENVELOPE WAS VELLUM, CREAM. FINE STRIATIONS, CRISP, no watermarks. Expensive. Scuffed at the corners, it had attracted grime as it was slid under the door, silently. The Doctor did not hear it, and his ears were keen, sharp as a crone's knees, like all his senses.  He was in the front room, had been throughout the evening, feeding the fire, absorbed in an obscure text. Forty-five minutes earlier, he had glanced up as the Petrovitch woman ascended the stairs, the scrabbly scuttle of her dachshund's claws dragging her back to an evening of heart-heavy sighs amid the torpid musk of stewed red cabbage. The Doctor watched their spidery shadows flit by, dancing off the glazed floorboards under the door. There had been no envelope.  He vaguely remembered wishing there were an easier way to examine his timepiece than extracting it from his waistcoat and cracking it open. That was why, when he spent an evening in, he set it open, on his reading table. Time, or rather the elimination of its senseless squandering, obsessed him. And he had looked at his watch when the rat dog and its scrawny, melancholic Russian mistress shuffled by: quarter past nine.  The text drew him back. Isis Unveiled. Surely this Blavatsky woman was mad: another Russian, like poor Petrovitch with her plum wine. When you uprooted these Czarists and tried to replant them in English soil, was lunacy some inevitable consequence? Coincidence, he reasoned; one heartsick spinster and a megalomaniacal, cigar-chomping Transcendentalist did not constitute a trend. 	120.0	120	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The Doctor is in his front room, reading an obscure text, when an envelope is silently slid under his door. He does not notice it at first, but later checks his watch and continues reading. 2: The Doctor spends the entire evening in his front room, so the envelope must have been delivered at some point during that time. The passage does not give any indication of how long the evening has been going on, but it does mention that the Doctor checks his watch at one point and sees that it is quarter past nine. Let's assume that the evening has been going on for at least two hours before the Doctor checks his watch.  3: The evening has been going on for at least two hours. At 60 minutes per hour, that's 120 minutes. 4: 120 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
210	FrosMT.txt|1|u	 He turned to study the photograph of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky in the frontispiece: the preternatural stillness, that clear, penetrating gaze. Most faces instinctively shrank from the insectoid jumble of the camera. She reached out and swallowed it whole. What was he to make of this curious tome? Isis Unveiled. Eight volumes to date, more threatened, all in excess of five hundred pages—and this only one-quarter of the woman's oeuvre—a work purporting to assimilate and eclipse, with a ringing absence of irony, every known spiritual, philosophic, and scientific system of thought: in other words, a revisionist theory of all creation.  Although, according to the biographical passage under her picture, HPB had spent the better part of her fifty-odd years trotting the globe communing with this or that occultist ashram, she coyly attributed the book's genesis to divine inspiration, courtesy of a steady roster of Ascended Masters materializing before her like Hamlet's Ghost, claiming that occasionally one of these Holy of Holies stepped inside her head and assumed the reins: automatic writing, she called it. True, the book possessed two distinctly different styles—he hesitated to term them “voices”—but as to content, the thing was a flea market of mumbo jumbo: lost continents, cosmic rays, root races, evil cabals of black magicians. To be fair, he had in fact employed similar notions in his own writing, but that was fiction, for God's sake, and she was offering this as theology. 	3.0	30	[1, 2, 0, 3]	VALID	1: The protagonist studies a photograph of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky and reads a book she wrote called 'Isis Unveiled.' He is skeptical of the book's content. 2: The protagonist spends some time studying the photograph and reading the book, but it's unclear how long this takes. Let's say he spends 30 minutes on this activity. 3: 30 minutes. 4: 30 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
211	FrosMT.txt|72|u	   He stopped to catch his breath under the vaulted exterior arch of St. Mary's Church. He waited ten minutes in the shadows for the dreadful flapping to emerge from the darkness, for some vile avenging shadow to blot out the stars and streak down at him out of the sky. As his breathing steadied, the sweat that had soaked his shirt cooled, leaving him cold and shivery. Lights burned invitingly in the nave. He moved inside.  What had he escaped from? In the warm, same light of the church, the question turned on him; had his imagination transformed perfectly ordinary circumstances—say, an overzealous night watchman whose corduroy pants produced an insistent hissing—into a wallow of self-generated terror? He had studied how the strain of combat could induce in soldiers all manner of hallucinatory mental phenomena. Was he not now laboring under an even more insidious strain, in that his antagonists were unknown to him and could be, as Sacker had suggested, any passing stranger in the street? Perhaps this was their preferred method of assault, driving their victims mad with a constant noncorporeal menace more sensed than seen. Show a man a target he can strike back against, and you lend him a footing. Attack him with inexplicable night sounds, will-o'-the wisps, macabre scarecrows by the sides of train tracks, incite the stuff of his own nightmares, and the suggestive vagueness of it alone could send him reeling into lunacy. 	12.0	15	[0, 3, 2, 1]	VALID	1: A man stops to catch his breath under a church arch, waits ten minutes, then goes inside the church. He reflects on whether his fear is justified or imagined. 2: The man waits for ten minutes, and then spends some time reflecting on his fear and the nature of fear in general. This could take anywhere from five to twenty minutes. 3: Let's say 15 minutes have elapsed.  4: 15 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

Frozen as if he'd spilled sand in his gears.  “A tune-up fight,” said Barry, after a respectful silence.  “Right,” said Bodger, thwacking himself in the face again and jolting his mental machinery free from its rut. “Like a tune-up fight. Some drongo. Want to see what Bodger's made of 'fore they puts their precious title on the line. So the Bodger says to them, wot's fair is fair. Never let it be said Champeen Nuggins is a piker: Old Bodger puts on a show, he does, when some right gents lays out a few sponduliacks to catch my action.”  “So you had this tune-up fight.” said Doyle.  Bodger nodded and squiffed out another squirt of hot juice. “First thing, they tells me the tune-up's not to take place in your stadium, your gamin' hall, or even in your ring, as such. What they do is, see, they takes me to this warehouse like, down by the ribber.”  “This was not a legally sanctioned bout,” said Doyle, feeling more and more like an interpreter for some idiot prince.  “Not the full quid, no,” said Bodger, seeming to comprehend. “But truff be known, we bare knucklers are not unfamiliar wit' the procedure.”  “So I take it that once you reached the wharf, these gentlemen introduced you to your opponent,” said Doyle patiently. 	2.0	4320	[1, 0, 2, 3]	VALID	1: Bodger is telling a story about a tune-up fight he had before a heavyweight title fight. He was taken to a warehouse by the river to fight an opponent he had not met before.  2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the story involves a series of events: the promise of a title fight, the request for a tune-up fight, the agreement to fight, the journey to the warehouse, and the fight itself. These events would take at least a few days to unfold. Let's say three days.  3: Three days have elapsed. At 24 hours a day that's 72 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 4320 minutes. 4: 4320 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

That principle is undoubtedly a good deal less class-conscious than I just stated.”  “No offense taken,” said Larry. “'Fink I'll have a peepers.” He lit his candle off the torch and wandered off around the next cluster of boxes.  “We can put a stop to their wanton thievery, that much is certain,” said Doyle.  “Sealing that tunnel will put an end to the robberies, though I fear the worst has already been done and the trail gone cold: Witness the ruined condition of that padlock on the iron doors.”  Doyle nodded, conceding the point.  “Whether or not we can successfully bring charges to bear against the firm of Rathborne and Sons for these crimes is a good deal less certain. It may not in fact be in our best interest.”  “How so, Jack?”  “Without a shred of physical evidence to support the accusation, an assault on the venerated, unsullied names of the Brotherhood through the plodding course of the courts will only vouchsafe their acquittal and drive them deeper to ground, while heaping untold ridicule upon ourselves. If we're to pursue them to the heart of their purpose, it's best we keep our efforts from public view until the moment we can strike decisively.”  A low whistle came from Larry on the other side of the bend.	2.0	5	[1, 0, 3, 2]	VALID	1: A group of people are discussing how to deal with a group of thieves. They consider sealing a tunnel and bringing charges against the thieves, but decide that the latter course of action would be unwise.  2: There are no explicit references to time, but the characters have a conversation and Larry wanders off with a candle. This probably takes at least a few minutes.  3: Let's say the conversation and Larry's wandering take five minutes.  4: 5 minutes. 5: High confidence.
214	FrosMT.txt|358|u	 “Keep walking; don't run,” said Sparks.  Doyle pulled up short and shook off Sparks's grip; they looked hard at each other. Doyle's ambivalence shot through his studied mask of passivity, and Sparks did not misinterpret it.  “There! Over there!”  The acrobats had spotted them and were pointing frantically through the crowd. The bobbies headed in their direction.  “Doyle, this is no time—”  “I don't know.”  “I can't allow you to stay here—”  “You're telling me I have no choice?”  “It's a longer conversation—”  “We need to have it.”  “Not now. For God's sake, man.”  Doyle wavered but would not be moved. The bobbies closed in.  “The boy, what he called me: Do you know what an arhanta is?” asked Sparks.  Doyle shook his head.  “It means savior.”  The bobbies were only a few yards away.  “Here, then, stand clear, you two!” said one of them.  Doyle shoved a bed in their direction, breaking their stride, and then he broke for the door. Sparks flew after him, and they burst through the door into a hospital corridor. An alarm sounded, and the pursuit behind them intensified.  “Which way?” asked Sparks.  Doyle pointed to their left, and they ran, dodging a host of startled patients and doctors and medical paraphernalia. Using his intimate knowledge of the hospital, changing directions frequently—in and out of wards, up and down stairs—and finally through a ground-floor window, Doyle led them to the entrance where Larry waited. A half-dozen bobbies were just arriving via Black Maria; Sparks blew a silver whistle that he'd pulled from his pocket and authoritatively waved them toward the doors. 	2.5	300	[1, 2, 3, 0]	VALID	1: Two characters, Sparks and Doyle, are being pursued by bobbies. They run through a hospital, dodging patients and medical equipment, and escape through a window.  2: The passage describes a chase through a hospital, which would take at least a few minutes. There is no explicit reference to how long the chase lasts, but it seems unlikely that it would take more than 10 minutes.  3: Let's say the chase took 5 minutes. Multiplying by 60 minutes per hour, that's 300 minutes.  4: 300 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
215	FrosMT.txt|410|u	I remembered Whitby because we'd played here once before, in the height of summer, and the sea and the sailing ships in the harbor had been so very beautiful, and I wanted to sit on a bench by the sea-wall and look out at the ships as I had that summer and not move and to think for the longest time, and maybe then I would begin to forget what had happened, maybe I could heal what had been done to my mind.…”  Tears were flowing down her cheeks, but she made no move to brush them away. Her voice remained even and strong. “The next day I took the train here. I had no other clothes to wear, but my cloak was full enough to cover the bloodstains on my dress. I spoke to no one. I completed the journey undisturbed, although I'm sure many remarks were made about the strange woman in the fancy evening dress, traveling without luggage or companion. I took a room here, like some haunted, heartbroken lover. I bought these poor clothes and sent my dress out to be cleaned. The blood had spoiled the satin, but I couldn't bear to part with it; it was my best dress, the only time I'd worn it before was New Year's Eve a year ago—I was so absurdly happy the night I wore that dress, I thought my life was just beginning and…” She paused again, before pulling back and saying, simply: “…and so I took a room here and slept and waited for the company to arrive.”  She looked back at Stoker, indicating the next chapter of the story was his arrival, which brought the tale to its current pass. Even Sparks's rectitude seemed mollified by the plain harshness of her ordeal. Doyle offered her his handkerchief, which she accepted without a word. 	2.3	720	[1, 2, 3, 0]	VALID	1: A woman recalls traveling to Whitby by train, wearing a bloodstained dress and a cloak, and taking a room there. She waits for company to arrive.  2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but the woman's journey by train would have taken at least a few hours, and her wait for company could have been a few hours or a few days. Let's say a total of 12 hours.  3: 12 hours have elapsed. Multiplying by 60 minutes an hour that's 720 minutes. 4: 720 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
216	FrosMT.txt|419|u	 “No. Are you?”  She laughed a little. It reminded him of tinkling crystal goblets at an impossibly glamorous dinner. “No, I'm not married.”  Doyle nodded intently, looked down at the shotgun in his hands, and with great concentration rubbed an imaginary smudge off the barrel.  “I've never given you proper thanks,” she said more soberly.  “None necessary,” he said with a casually dismissing wave.  “Still. I owe you my life. You and Mr. Sparks.”  “There's no reason for you to feel indebted in even the slightest way, Miss Temple. Given the chance, I would gladly do the same again and more,” he said, feeling emboldened. This time he held her eyes until she looked away.  She needed somewhere to stub out her cigarette. There was no ashtray on the bedstand. Casting around, Doyle came up with the wrapper from the biscuits and held it for her on the table as she tapped out the smoke. Their fingers brushed together lightly with an electric tingle that he didn't believe he was imagining.  “I want to help you,” she said in a low and husky voice. “In any way I can. You must convey that to Mr. Sparks. Because, you see, I feel a certain responsibility.”  “You acted out of need. Urgent financial need. You couldn't know what would happen. You had no way of knowing.”  As she finished with the cigarette, she looked up, and their faces were only inches apart. 	2.0	180	[3, 2, 1, 0]	VALID	1: A man and a woman have a conversation in a room.

Barry immediately jumped down after her. Larry pulled his knives and moved to the right, while Sparks drew a bead with the shotgun.  “Be gone, stupid spirits, fly away, disperse, or you'll make us very angry—”  The ghostly voices suddenly stilled. Eileen stopped ten feet away from the penitent wraiths.  “That's better,” she said approvingly. “Now the rest of you girls just trot on off as well. Go on.”  The ghostly figures lowered their hands. Barry slowly moved after Eileen, only a few strides behind her now.  “Miss Temple,” said Sparks, loud and clear, “move away from the center of the room, please.”  “We run into ghosts in the theater all the time—” she said.  “Please do as I say, now.”  She turned back to Sparks to argue. “There's nothing to worry about, they're perfectly harmless—”  Moving as one, the ghostly figures threw back their hoods, revealing hideously deformed and hairless heads that looked half human and half predatory bird. They let loose a shrill, paralyzing shriek and rose up above Eileen to a height of ten feet or more, preparing to strike.	1.8	0.45	[3, 0, 2, 1]	VALID	1: A group of people are in a room with ghostly figures.

Let's say the events take 30 seconds to a minute. 3: 45 seconds have elapsed. Multiplying by 60 seconds in a minute, that's 27 seconds. 4: 27 seconds. 5: High confidence.
218	FrosMT.txt|439|u	 Bright light and the rush of many footsteps entered the cathedral. Sparks picked up the lid and ran out the door.  “Hurry!” he said.  Doyle and Eileen gathered the snowshoes, and they scrambled after Sparks. He dropped the lid so it hung over the lip of the hill that sloped steeply away from the ruins and anchored it with his foot.  “You first, Doyle. Grab the handles and hold on,” said Sparks.  The main band of pursuers burst out of the abbey behind them toward their position, a black-cloaked figure in the lead. Doyle pocketed his gun and jumped aboard. Sparks grabbed Eileen around the waist, pushed her down on the middle of the lid, and followed her onto it, using his weight to tip them over the edge. They slid forward and rapidly accelerated down the incline as the pack reached the lip: Two hoods hurled themselves after the makeshift sled, one raked a hand across Sparks's back, nearly dislodging him before they pulled away from the tumbling bodies. The sled gained speed as they plummeted down the embankment in the dark; every bump and hillock sent them flying into the air, only to be rocked heavily as they hit the snow again.  “Can you steer?” shouted Sparks.  “I don't think so!” answered Doyle. It was all he could do to hang on. The sheer cliffs falling to the sea somewhere on the right and their unknown proximity to them hurtled into his mind. 	1.6	2.0	[3, 1, 2, 0]	VALID	1: A group of people flee from pursuers, using a lid as a makeshift sled to slide down a hill.  2: The passage describes a series of actions that would take at least a few minutes. The sled ride itself is probably only a few seconds, but the process of getting onto the sled, sliding down the hill, and worrying about cliffs would take at least a minute.  3: Let's say two minutes have elapsed. At 60 seconds a minute, that's 120 seconds. 4: 120 seconds. 5: High confidence.
219	FrosMT.txt|475|u	 “But it is a most provocative subject, don't you agree?” asked Chandros, who apparently felt no further introductions necessary.  “A heady matter indeed,” said Doyle.  Chandros laughed genuinely. “Yes. Heady. Very good. Heady: Do you like that, Marcus?”  Drummond snorted, Doyle assumed disapprovingly.  “Marcus has been in violent need of a good, solid belly laugh for the last thirty years,” said Chandros. “And he needs it still.”  Drummond snorted again, seeming to confirm the opinion.  “For an accredited cynic and somewhat notorious man of the world, my friend the General manages to retain a remarkable naïveté.” Chandros took Doyle's arm in his before he could respond and directed him down the corridor. “However, Doctor, apropos our prior discussion, regardless of its particular unlikelihood, I strongly believe that as a race of people we are on the verge of such a vast sea change of scientific discovery that it will transform forever life as we have known it.”  Another snort from Drummond: There were apparently shadings and nuances to the man's use of the exclamation that would require months to interpret. 	1.7	5	[3, 0, 1, 2]	VALID	1: Three men are discussing a provocative subject. One of them, Chandros, takes Doyle's arm and directs him down the corridor. 2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the events described would take at least a few minutes. The men exchange several lines of dialogue, and Chandros physically moves Doyle down the corridor. Let's say five minutes. 3: 5 minutes have elapsed. 4: 5 minutes. 5: High confidence.
220	FrosMT.txt|533|u	 “Leaving his son the Crown Prince, half-orphaned, adored by all, to take his place in succession behind his grandfather the King. Then it's a fairly simple matter; shuffle King Bertie and any inconvenient heirs off their mortal coil and it's Bonny Prince So-and-so in the coronation coach on his way to Windsor.”  “But it could take twenty years.”  “Raising the child from infancy takes that long regardless. Meanwhile, our friends in the Seven consolidate their positions as peddlers of influence to the royal family. Before the accession, the young King is made carefully aware of the lineage of his left-handed path to power—initiated into the fold—and so begins his thousand-year reign at the head of the most powerful nation on earth.”  Sparks sat back. Doyle was astonished at how the scenario could sound so practical and at the same time utterly insane.  “Why would they do it, Jack?”  “A king can wage war. They're in the business of building weapons. There's a pragmatic reason. Perhaps the only sort with which we should concern ourselves for the moment.”  Doyle nodded, the coolness of this rationality as refreshing as spring water. “And the land. The convicts. Vamberg's drug.”  “Man as rough clay. Playing at god,” said Sparks with a shrug.  “There must be a more practical use.”  Sparks paused. “Building a private militia.”  “For their defense?”  “Or some more belligerent purpose.”  “But the treatment didn't work. Not with any reliability,” said Doyle, thinking of the ruined men being force-marched to their deaths. 	2.0	13140000	[1, 0, 2, 3]	VALID	1: Two characters discuss a plan to put a young prince on the throne of England, and the potential benefits of doing so. They also discuss the use of convicts and a drug called Vamberg's drug. 2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but the characters discuss raising a child from infancy, which takes at least 18 years. The plan to put the prince on the throne could take an additional 20 years. The conversation itself probably takes a few minutes. Let's say 25 years. 3: 25 years have elapsed. At 365 days a year that's 9125 days x 24 hours in a day, so 219000 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 13140000 minutes. 4: 13140000 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the estimate is based on speculation about the time required to raise a child and the duration of the plan to put the prince on the throne.
221	FrosMT.txt|536|u	 “So as to what you witnessed on the night we rode to Whitby…in spite of my best efforts in the intervening months, I have not altogether rid myself of this…dependence.”  “Is there anything I—”  “Having said just that much… I must call upon you as a friend and a gentleman and insist that we never speak another word of this matter again.”  The muscles in Sparks's jaw clenched tight. His eyes went hard, his voice hoarse with emotion, withdrawn.  “Of course, Jack,” said Doyle.  Sparks nodded, rose abruptly from the table, and moved out the door before Doyle could react. The weight of this new knowledge added to Doyle's oppressive weariness. He staggered to the rear of the car and looked in through the drawn curtains at Eileen in the lower berth. She hadn't moved from the position he had first seen her assume, her breathing slow and regular. As quietly as he could manage—holding at bay a befogged awareness that this decision carried more import than could possibly seem apparent—Doyle climbed to the upper berth. Sleep—a sonorous, black, unconscious deep—came and took him quickly.    Doyle opened his eyes. No sensation of movement; the train was not moving. Daylight filtered into the berth. He looked at his watch—quarter past two in the afternoon—and parted the curtains, squinting against the brightness: a train yard, the one they had used before in Battersea, south of the city. He swung his feet over the side and climbed down. The lower berth was empty, as was the rest of the car. He exited. 	2.5	90	[2, 0, 1, 3]	VALID	1: Doyle and Sparks have a conversation about something that happened on a night ride to Whitby. Sparks insists they never speak of it again, then leaves abruptly. Doyle goes to bed and wakes up in a train yard. 2: Doyle goes to bed and wakes up in a train yard, so at least several hours have passed. The conversation with Sparks and Doyle's reflection on it might have taken 30 minutes to an hour.  3: Let's say an hour and a half has elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour that's 90 minutes. 4: 90 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
222	FrosMT.txt|556|u	 After puzzling it through, and after many long discussions with his beloved Louise, Doyle realized at last that what disturbed him most deeply, what haunted his waking hours, was the thought that this vivid, valiant, and extraordinary man, who had selflessly given his life for Queen and country, could vanish from the earth without so much as a moment's acknowledgment. This was a profound injustice. Although he had personally sworn his service and secrecy in this matter to the Queen—and she was to call on him again, repeatedly, in years to come—Doyle in the end devised a way to honor his sworn oath to her, while paying tribute to the memory of the late Jonathan Sparks.  That night, with his wife and child lying safely in their beds, he reached for the pen that the Queen had given him and sat down to write a story about their mysterious friend.      EPILOGUE     “THERE, THE RIVER GOES DEEP THERE, AT THE BASE OF THE rocks. Current below is deep. Fast. The bodies, they are not always found.”  Doyle stands on the boardwalk at the rim overlooking Reichenbach Falls, as his hired Swiss guide, a broad-faced genial young man, points down at the cataract below.  “People jump, from there, you see,” the guide explains. “Women most frequent. Broken hearts. So many, over the years.” The man shook his head in an earnest simulation of despond.  “I understand,” says Doyle. 	1440.0	5	[2, 3, 1, 0]	VALID	1: Doyle reflects on the injustice of Jonathan Sparks' death going unnoticed, and decides to write a story about him. In the epilogue, he stands on a boardwalk with a Swiss guide who points out a dangerous spot where people have jumped to their deaths.  2: Writing a story takes time, but the passage doesn't say how long Doyle spends on it. The epilogue describes a brief conversation, which might take five minutes.  3: Let's say five minutes have elapsed.  4: 5 minutes.  5: High confidence.
223	FrosMT.txt|557|u	 “Very sad place.”  “Yes. Very sad.”  A bright April morning in 1890. Publishing success about to transform his life forever, Dr. Doyle, Louise, and three-year-old daughter Mary Louise are enjoying their first excursion abroad.  “Has anyone ever survived?” asks Doyle.  The guide's brow knits tightly. “One woman. Yes. She comes out, seven kilometers south down the river. Does not remember her name.”  Doyle nods, letting his gaze drift across the turbid water.  Farther down the boardwalk, strolling with her mother, little Mary Louise is captivated by the sight of an infant in its passing perambulator.  “Mummy, look at the baby,” she says, leaning over the edge to peer down at the child.  The parents, an unremarkable lower-middle-class couple, are taking a first vacation since the birth of their son the year before. The father, Alois, is a customs official, the mother, Klara, a simple country girl from Bavaria.  “Look at the eyes, Mummy,” says Mary. “Doesn't it have the most beautiful eyes?”  The baby's eyes are indeed beautiful. Inviting. Transfixing.  “Yes, he does, dear. Die Augen ist…sehr schön,” says Louise to the young parents, in her schoolgirl German.  “Thank you,” says Klara politely.  “Wo kommen Sie heraus?” asks Louise.  “We come from Austria,” answers Alois, uncomfortable with any foreigner, let alone an English gentlewoman.  Doyle, with the guard at the rail forty feet away, fails to notice their conversation. 	2.0	4	[0, 2, 3, 1]	VALID	1: Dr. Doyle, his wife Louise, and their daughter Mary Louise are on a trip abroad in 1890. They are looking at a river and discussing a sad place where only one person has survived. Meanwhile, Mary Louise is captivated by a baby in a perambulator and speaks to the baby's parents in German. 2: The events described take place over a few minutes. The conversation with the guide and the observation of the river might take a few minutes, while Mary Louise's conversation with the baby's parents might take a minute or less.  3: Let's say four minutes have elapsed.  4: 4 minutes. 5: High confidence.

As Klara turns the pram around she leans down to straighten her son's bedding. She smiles at him, and says softly:  “Komm mit, Adolf.”       	1.0	1	[3, 0, 2, 1]	VALID	1: A family is saying goodbye to another family. The father takes Klara by the arm and turns her around, and they say goodbye. Mary runs to tell her father about the baby, but forgets by the time she reaches him. Klara turns the pram around and speaks softly to her son. 2: The events described are brief and happen in quick succession. It takes a few seconds to say goodbye, and a few more seconds for Mary to run to her father. Klara takes a moment to straighten her son's bedding and speak to him. Let's say the whole thing takes a minute. 3: 1 minute has elapsed. 4: 1 minute. 5: High confidence.
225	robinsoncrusoe.txt|0|u	 CHAPTER I—START IN LIFE   I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family, though not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled first at Hull. He got a good estate by merchandise, and leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he had married my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very good family in that country, and from whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of words in England, we are now called—nay we call ourselves and write our name—Crusoe; and so my companions always called me.  I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards. What became of my second brother I never knew, any more than my father or mother knew what became of me.  Being the third son of the family and not bred to any trade, my head began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. My father, who was very ancient, had given me a competent share of learning, as far as house-education and a country free school generally go, and designed me for the law; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea; and my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will, nay, the commands of my father, and against all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that propensity of nature, tending directly to the life of misery which was to befall me. 	13140000.0	8409600	[1, 0, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator, Robinson Crusoe, introduces himself and his family. He explains that he was born in 1632 in York, England, to a family with a foreign father who made his fortune in trade. Robinson was not interested in the law, which his father had intended for him, but instead wanted to go to sea.  2: The passage describes Robinson's birth and early life, as well as his family's history. It also explains his desire to go to sea, which suggests that some time has passed since his birth. Let's say he was at least 16 years old when he decided to go to sea, which would give him enough time to develop a strong inclination towards it.  3: Let's say 16 years have elapsed. At 365 days a year that's 5840 days x 24 hours in a day, so 140160 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 8409600 minutes. 4: 8409600 minutes. 5: Low confidence, as the estimate is based on speculation about the narrator's age when he decided to go to sea.
226	robinsoncrusoe.txt|1|u	 My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He called me one morning into his chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject. He asked me what reasons, more than a mere wandering inclination, I had for leaving father's house and my native country, where I might be well introduced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune by application and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. He told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring, superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the common road; that these things were all either too far above me or too far below me; that mine was the middle state, or what might be called the upper station of low life, which he had found, by long experience, was the best state in the world, the most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries and hardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the upper part of mankind. He told me I might judge of the happiness of this state by this one thing—viz. that this was the state of life which all other people envied; that kings have frequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born to great things, and wished they had been placed in the middle of the two extremes, between the mean and the great; that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as the standard of felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty nor riches. 	20.0	15768000	[3, 1, 0, 2]	VALID	1: A father tries to convince his son not to leave home and go on adventures. He argues that the son's current position in life is the best one, and that the son should be content with it. 2: The father's speech is a reflection on life, rather than a description of events. However, the father does mention that he has had 'long experience' of the son's current position in life. Let's say that the father has had 30 years of experience with this position.  3: 30 years have elapsed. At 365 days a year that's 10950 days x 24 hours in a day, so 262800 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 15768000 minutes. 4: 15768000 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the passage is a reflection on life rather than a description of events.
227	robinsoncrusoe.txt|69|u	 I cast my eye to the stranded vessel, when, the breach and froth of the sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far of; and considered, Lord! how was it possible I could get on shore?  After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my condition, I began to look round me, to see what kind of place I was in, and what was next to be done; and I soon found my comforts abate, and that, in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance; for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor anything either to eat or drink to comfort me; neither did I see any prospect before me but that of perishing with hunger or being devoured by wild beasts; and that which was particularly afflicting to me was, that I had no weapon, either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance, or to defend myself against any other creature that might desire to kill me for theirs. In a word, I had nothing about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box. This was all my provisions; and this threw me into such terrible agonies of mind, that for a while I ran about like a madman. Night coming upon me, I began with a heavy heart to consider what would be my lot if there were any ravenous beasts in that country, as at night they always come abroad for their prey. 	240.0	10	[2, 3, 1, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator has been shipwrecked and is stranded on a beach. They look around and realize they have no food, water, or weapons, and are in danger of being killed by wild animals. 2: The passage describes the narrator's thoughts and actions, which would have taken some time. Let's say it takes 10 minutes to look around, consider their situation, and start to panic.  3: 10 minutes have elapsed. 4: 10 minutes. 5: High confidence.
228	robinsoncrusoe.txt|114|u	This was not so difficult to me as the making the shovel: and yet this and the shovel, and the attempt which I made in vain to make a wheelbarrow, took me up no less than four days—I mean always excepting my morning walk with my gun, which I seldom failed, and very seldom failed also bringing home something fit to eat.  _Nov._ 23.—My other work having now stood still, because of my making these tools, when they were finished I went on, and working every day, as my strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days entirely in widening and deepening my cave, that it might hold my goods commodiously.  _Note_.—During all this time I worked to make this room or cave spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse or magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar. As for my lodging, I kept to the tent; except that sometimes, in the wet season of the year, it rained so hard that I could not keep myself dry, which caused me afterwards to cover all my place within my pale with long poles, in the form of rafters, leaning against the rock, and load them with flags and large leaves of trees, like a thatch. 	33120.0	31680	[1, 2, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator describes making a shovel and attempting to make a wheelbarrow, which took four days. He then spent 18 days widening and deepening his cave to use as a warehouse, kitchen, dining room, and cellar.  2: The passage explicitly states that the narrator spent four days making the shovel and attempting to make a wheelbarrow, and then 18 days widening and deepening his cave. The passage also mentions that the narrator goes on a morning walk with his gun and brings home food, but it is unclear how much time this takes. Let's estimate that the narrator spends an hour each morning on his walk and gathering food.  3: The narrator spent 22 days on these tasks. At 24 hours per day, that's 528 hours. At 60 minutes per hour, that's 31,680 minutes.  4: 31,680 minutes.  5: High confidence.
229	robinsoncrusoe.txt|122|u	 I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in their season, which was about the end of June; and, laying up every corn, I resolved to sow them all again, hoping in time to have some quantity sufficient to supply me with bread. But it was not till the fourth year that I could allow myself the least grain of this corn to eat, and even then but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards, in its order; for I lost all that I sowed the first season by not observing the proper time; for I sowed it just before the dry season, so that it never came up at all, at least not as it would have done; of which in its place.  Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same care and for the same use, or to the same purpose—to make me bread, or rather food; for I found ways to cook it without baking, though I did that also after some time.  But to return to my Journal.  I worked excessive hard these three or four months to get my wall done; and the 14th of April I closed it up, contriving to go into it, not by a door but over the wall, by a ladder, that there might be no sign on the outside of my habitation. 	161280.0	2246400	[2, 1, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator describes saving corn and rice, and sowing the corn for four years before finally being able to eat it. The narrator also describes working hard for three or four months to build a wall, which was completed on April 14th. 2: The passage describes four years passing between the time the corn was first saved and the time the narrator was able to eat it. The time it took to build the wall is also described as three or four months. Let's say four months to be safe.  3: Four years plus four months is 52 months. 30 days in a month, so 1560 days. 24 hours in a day, so 37440 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 2246400 minutes. 4: 2246400 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

I had three large axes, and abundance of hatchets (for we carried the hatchets for traffic with the Indians); but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard wood, they were all full of notches, and dull; and though I had a grindstone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too. This cost me as much thought as a statesman would have bestowed upon a grand point of politics, or a judge upon the life and death of a man. At length I contrived a wheel with a string, to turn it with my foot, that I might have both my hands at liberty. _Note_.—I had never seen any such thing in England, or at least, not to take notice how it was done, though since I have observed, it is very common there; besides that, my grindstone was very large and heavy. This machine cost me a full week's work to bring it to perfection.  _April_ 28, 29.—These two whole days I took up in grinding my tools, my machine for turning my grindstone performing very well.  _April_ 30.—Having perceived my bread had been low a great while, now I took a survey of it, and reduced myself to one biscuit cake a day, which made my heart very heavy. 	12960.0	12960	[3, 0, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator spends a week constructing a machine to grind his tools, then spends two days grinding his tools. On the third day, he realizes he's running low on bread and reduces his intake to one biscuit cake a day. 2: The narrator spends a week constructing a machine, then two days grinding his tools. The time he spends reducing his bread intake is not specified, but it's probably at least a day or two. Let's say two days. 3: The narrator spends 9 days working on his tools and bread. At 24 hours a day that's 216 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 12960 minutes. 4: 12960 minutes. 5: High confidence.
231	robinsoncrusoe.txt|147|u	 The 30th was my well day, of course, and I went abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel too far. I killed a sea-fowl or two, something like a brandgoose, and brought them home, but was not very forward to eat them; so I ate some more of the turtle's eggs, which were very good. This evening I renewed the medicine, which I had supposed did me good the day before—the tobacco steeped in rum; only I did not take so much as before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke; however, I was not so well the next day, which was the first of July, as I hoped I should have been; for I had a little spice of the cold fit, but it was not much.  _July_ 2.—I renewed the medicine all the three ways; and dosed myself with it as at first, and doubled the quantity which I drank.  _July_ 3.—I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not recover my full strength for some weeks after. While I was thus gathering strength, my thoughts ran exceedingly upon this Scripture, “I will deliver thee”; and the impossibility of my deliverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever expecting it; but as I was discouraging myself with such thoughts, it occurred to my mind that I pored so much upon my deliverance from the main affliction, that I disregarded the deliverance I had received, and I was as it were made to ask myself such questions as these—viz.	5760.0	2880	[1, 0, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator describes several days of his life on the island, including hunting, eating, and taking medicine. He reflects on his deliverance from his affliction. 2: The passage describes several days, including the 30th of June, the 1st of July, the 2nd of July, and the 3rd of July. The narrator goes hunting, eats, and takes medicine. It's unclear how long these activities take, but let's say each day's activities take 12 hours.  3: Four days have elapsed. At 12 hours a day, that's 48 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 2880 minutes. 4: 2880 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my castle, and began to be much easier now, as to the safety of my circumstances, than ever I was before: for I observed that these wretches never came to this island in search of what they could get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not expecting anything here; and having often, no doubt, been up the covered, woody part of it without finding anything to their purpose.	120.0	15	[2, 3, 1, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator expresses gratitude for being on an island where he is not surrounded by dangerous creatures.

This fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks, and I was so full of it that I often dreamed of it, and, sometimes, that I was just going to let fly at them in my sleep.	30240.0	30240	[1, 0, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator considers various ways to attack a group of people who have been killing and eating his goats. He considers blowing them up with gunpowder, but decides against it, and then considers ambushing them with guns and swords.

He had no clothes on but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but nothing to direct me so much as to guess what nation he was of. He had nothing in his pockets but two pieces of eight and a tobacco pipe—the last was to me of ten times more value than the first.  It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I might find something on board that might be useful to me. But that did not altogether press me so much as the possibility that there might be yet some living creature on board, whose life I might not only save, but might, by saving that life, comfort my own to the last degree; and this thought clung so to my heart that I could not be quiet night or day, but I must venture out in my boat on board this wreck; and committing the rest to God's providence, I thought the impression was so strong upon my mind that it could not be resisted—that it must come from some invisible direction, and that I should be wanting to myself if I did not go. 	7200.0	4320	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator describes finding the corpse of a drowned boy on the shore of the island where he has been stranded. He considers going out to the wreck of the ship to see if there are any survivors or anything useful to him there. 2: The narrator spends some time considering whether to go out to the wreck, and this thought 'clung so to my heart that I could not be quiet night or day.' This suggests that at least a few days pass before he decides to go. Let's say three days. 3: Three days have elapsed.

235	robinsoncrusoe.txt|332|u	After I had begun to eat some I gave some to my man, who seemed very glad of it, and liked it very well; but that which was strangest to him was to see me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that the salt was not good to eat; and putting a little into his own mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it, washing his mouth with fresh water after it: on the other hand, I took some meat into my mouth without salt, and I pretended to spit and sputter for want of salt, as much as he had done at the salt; but it would not do; he would never care for salt with meat or in his broth; at least, not for a great while, and then but a very little.  Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was resolved to feast him the next day by roasting a piece of the kid: this I did by hanging it before the fire on a string, as I had seen many people do in England, setting two poles up, one on each side of the fire, and one across the top, and tying the string to the cross stick, letting the meat turn continually. This Friday admired very much; but when he came to taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how well he liked it, that I could not but understand him: and at last he told me, as well as he could, he would never eat man's flesh any more, which I was very glad to hear. 	1440.0	180	[0, 3, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator feeds his man some boiled meat and broth, and then resolves to roast a piece of kid for him the next day.

He also expresses his enjoyment of the roasted meat and indicates that he will not eat human flesh again. 2: The events described in the passage probably took a few hours. The narrator has to prepare the meat and broth, feed his man, and then make plans to roast the kid the next day. The man also has to eat the food and express his enjoyment of it.  3: Let's say three hours have elapsed.  4: 180 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

I took a small bottle of rum in my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more powder and bullets; and as to orders, I charged him to keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do anything till I bid him, and in the meantime not to speak a word. In this posture I fetched a compass to my right hand of near a mile, as well to get over the creek as to get into the wood, so that I could come within shot of them before I should be discovered, which I had seen by my glass it was easy to do.  While I was making this march, my former thoughts returning, I began to abate my resolution: I do not mean that I entertained any fear of their number, for as they were naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was superior to them—nay, though I had been alone. But it occurred to my thoughts, what call, what occasion, much less what necessity I was in to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people who had neither done or intended me any wrong?	20.0	2700	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator arms himself and Friday, and they march out.

As soon as they got to the place where their other boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach and came all on shore, hauling the boat up after them, which I was glad to see, for I was afraid they would rather have left the boat at an anchor some distance from the shore, with some hands in her to guard her, and so we should not be able to seize the boat. Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran all to their other boat; and it was easy to see they were under a great surprise to find her stripped, as above, of all that was in her, and a great hole in her bottom. After they had mused a while upon this, they set up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all their might, to try if they could make their companions hear; but all was to no purpose. 	18.0	5	[0, 1, 2, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator and six other men are waiting for ten others to arrive. The ten arrive, but are surprised to find their boat stripped and damaged. They shout for their companions, but no one answers. 2: The events described in the passage would have taken at least a few minutes, as the ten men arrive, run their boat ashore, and shout for their companions. It's difficult to say exactly how long this would take, but let's say five minutes. 3: Five minutes have elapsed. 4: 5 minutes. 5: High confidence.
238	robinsoncrusoe.txt|429|u	 After these ceremonies were past, and after all his good things were brought into my little apartment, we began to consult what was to be done with the prisoners we had; for it was worth considering whether we might venture to take them with us or no, especially two of them, whom he knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree; and the captain said he knew they were such rogues that there was no obliging them, and if he did carry them away, it must be in irons, as malefactors, to be delivered over to justice at the first English colony he could come to; and I found that the captain himself was very anxious about it. Upon this, I told him that, if he desired it, I would undertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make it their own request that he should leave them upon the island. “I should be very glad of that,” says the captain, “with all my heart.” “Well,” says I, “I will send for them up and talk with them for you.” So I caused Friday and the two hostages, for they were now discharged, their comrades having performed their promise; I say, I caused them to go to the cave, and bring up the five men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep them there till I came. After some time, I came thither dressed in my new habit; and now I was called governor again.	60.0	180	[0, 1, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The passage describes a conversation between the narrator and the captain about what to do with prisoners.

The narrator has to send for Friday and the hostages, have them go to the cave, bring up the prisoners, and talk to them. This would take some time, even if the distance between the bower and the cave is not very far. Let's say it takes 3 hours. 3: 3 hours have elapsed.

In thisvoyage I visited my new colony in the island, saw my successors the Spaniards, had the old story of their lives and of the villains I left there; how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards, how theyafterwards agreed, disagreed, united, separated, and how at last theSpaniards were obliged to use violence with them; how they were subjected to the Spaniards, how honestly the Spaniards used them—a history, if it were entered into, as full of variety and wonderful accidents as my ownpart—particularly, also, as to their battles with the Caribbeans, who landed several times upon the island, and as to the improvement they made upon the island itself, and how five of them made an attempt upon themainland, and brought away eleven men and five women prisoners, by which, at my coming, I found about twenty young children on the island.	9000000.0	5256000	[2, 3, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator describes settling down, marrying, having children, and then going on a voyage to the East Indies in 1694.

The voyage itself would have taken several months, and the time spent settling down and raising a family would have taken years. Let's say 10 years have elapsed since the narrator's marriage.  3: 10 years have elapsed. At 365 days a year that's 3650 days x 24 hours in a day, so 87600 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 5256000 minutes. 4: 5256000 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

As to the Englishmen, I promised to send them some women from England, with a good cargo of necessaries, if they would apply themselves to planting—which I afterwards could not perform. The fellows proved very honest and diligent after they were mastered and had their properties set apart for them. I sent them, also, from the Brazils, five cows, three of them being big with calf, some sheep, and some hogs, which when I came again were considerably increased.  But all these things, with an account how three hundred Caribbees came and invaded them, and ruined their plantations, and how they fought with that whole number twice, and were at first defeated, and one of them killed; but at last, a storm destroying their enemies' canoes, they famished or destroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and recovered the possession of their plantation, and still lived upon the island.  All these things, with some very surprising incidents in some new adventures of my own, for ten years more, I shall give a farther account of in the Second Part of my Story. 	5256000.0	86400	[2, 0, 1, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator describes sending supplies and people to an island, including seven women, and sending more supplies later.

The narrator also mentions sending more supplies later. The Englishmen on the island become honest and diligent, and the narrator sends them animals. The passage doesn't give a specific time frame, but these events would have taken at least several weeks, if not months. Let's say two months. 3: Two months have elapsed.

241	BoswJDS.txt|0|u	DORANDO, A SPANISH TALE. IN the rich and beautiful province of Andalusia lived the prince of Dorando, of the race of the ancient kings of Arragon. His family had long subsisted in splendour, and several branches of it were established in different parts of Europe. But Don Carlos, the last of the male line, having in his youth had some difference with his sovereign, quitted the court, and taking a disgust at the world, shut himself up in the castle of his ancestors. Here he lived in retirement for upwards of thirty years; and although a prince of admirable parts, yet in  this gloom of solitude his mind lost its natural vigour; and, indifferent about his affairs, he resigned himself to the guidance of people who were artful enough to insinuate themselves into his favour. Don Carlos had no brothers; but an only sister, amiable and accomplished, educated by the princess her mother in the strictest honour and piety. This lady refused many advantageous offers of marriage from sentiments of delicacy rarely to be found in one of her rank. She was often asked by her brother to marry; but she diverted the discourse by telling him, that it was his duty to continue his illustrious line. At last she listened to the addresses of Don Spiritoso, a cavalier of good family, somewhat advanced in life, but of very engaging manners. The princess Maria  herself, was then in her forty seventh year. 	16819200.0	15768000	[3, 1, 2, 0]	VALID	1: This passage tells the story of a prince of Dorando who retires to his castle for thirty years, and whose sister eventually marries a man named Don Spiritoso.  2: The passage describes thirty years of retirement for the prince, and the sister's marriage, but does not describe the events in detail. We can guess that the sister's marriage took at least a few weeks or months to arrange.  3: Let's say the sister's marriage took two months to arrange. Thirty years is 10,950 days. 24 hours in a day, so 262,800 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 15,768,000 minutes.  4: 15,768,000 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because of the vagueness of the passage.
242	BoswJDS.txt|1|u	Their nuptials were privately celebrated by the bishop of the city where they lived: for, understanding that the prince of Dorando had taken up some prejudice against Don Spiritoso, they resolved to conceal their marriage; and accordingly set out for France, taking with them Donna Justina, who had lived both with the princess and her mother in the character of a waiting-woman. They resided for some time in a pleasant village in France, till the princess became pregnant, and her marriage could no longer be concealed; while at the same time she hoped, that the prince her brother could not be offended at an event, of which he should no sooner hear, than he should also be informed of its happy consequences.  The princess therefore wrote an affectionate letter to her brother, acquainting him of her situation, and begging his kind protection; but alas! the worthy prince had already been most unhappily imposed upon. For in the neighbourhood of Dorando lived the prince of Arvidoso, who by an intermarriage of the families entertained some hopes of succession to the estate of Dorando. The adherents therefore of the family of Arvidoso did all in their power to poison the ear and vex the noble spirit of the unsuspecting Dorando. The principal of these adherents were Don Stocaccio, Don Tipponi, and Don Rodomontado. These three never ceased to throw the most injurious suspicions upon the character of the absent princess. They exaggerated every imprudency in the conduct of Don Spiritoso,  so as to prevent any hope of the prince being reconciled to his marriage with the lady Maria. At last the princess went to Paris, where she was safely delivered of two sons. 	525600.0	259200	[2, 0, 1, 3]	VALID	1: The passage describes the marriage of two people, who conceal it because of a prejudice against the groom. They go to France with a waiting-woman, live there for a while, and then the princess becomes pregnant. She writes to her brother, hoping he will be happy for her, but he has already been misled by people who want to inherit his estate. The princess goes to Paris and has two sons. 2: The passage doesn't give any explicit indication of how much time has passed, but it seems likely that the events described would take at least several months. The couple gets married, travels to France, lives there for a while, and then the princess becomes pregnant and has two sons. All of this would take some time, even if we don't know exactly how much.  3: Let's say that the events described take six months. That's 180 days x 24 hours in a day, so 4320 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 259200 minutes. 4: 259200 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the estimate is based on speculation.
243	BoswJDS.txt|3|u	The unfortunate Dorando believed the barbarous tale. He did not imagine that any man alive could have dared to tell the prince of Dorando, that his sister was an abandoned and infamous woman, had it not been true beyond a possibility of doubt. He felt the deepest anguish; but his spirit was roused with indignation; and he resolved never again to see his sister, and to show her every mark of his displeasure. Having brought him to this state of mind, the adherents had no difficulty to accomplish their designs. The gentlest hints were sufficient; so that the prince of Dorando settled his  opulent domains on the house of Arvidoso, and sunk a family which had been illustrious for ages. The princess Maria immediately returned to Spain with her husband and children. Her brother had withdrawn from her even the appointments which he had assigned for maintaining her court; and had it not been for the generosity of some of the neighbouring princes, the lady Maria Dorando must have been reduced to actual want. All who lived under her brother lamented her situation. They crouded to see the children, and it was universally agreed, that Don Ferdinand, the eldest, had a strong resemblance to the prince his uncle; and that Don Philip, the youngest, was the very picture of his mother. The honest peasants kissed the hands of  the young princes with the sincerest marks of joy and affection, wishing that the prince could only see his nephews, as that would be sufficient to convince him how false were the suspicions against them. 	525600.0	0	[0, 1, 2, 3]	CALC ERROR	1: The passage describes how the prince of Dorando was tricked into believing his sister was an infamous woman, and how he subsequently disinherited her and her family. The princess Maria returned to Spain with her husband and children, and would have been destitute if not for the generosity of some neighboring princes.  2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but it seems likely that the prince's anger and subsequent disinheritance of his sister would have taken at least a few days. The princess's return to Spain would have taken longer, perhaps a week or two.  3: Let's say a week has elapsed.  4: 10080 minutes (60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, 7 days in a week).  5: Moderate confidence.
244	BoswJDS.txt|4|u	But the prince had received too strong impressions, and was too closely watched. Often did the lady Maria write to him in the most moving terms; but all in vain. She at last resolved to make a desperate effort, and went to the gate of his castle with her two children. And there did the princess Dorando and her sons stand like the lowest supplicants, till the prince should return an answer to a pathetic letter which she sent up to him. The prince began to relent. He walked through his castle musing with much agitation, while the big tear ran down his  cheek. But Stocaccio, like a hellhound, dogged him from room to room, and with a villainous appearance of concern, bid him be firm, nor weakly yield to the whining of a woman, who had forfeited every claim to his regard. The prince overcome with a tumult of contending passions, retired to his closet; and Stocaccio desired the servants to tell the lady Maria, that she could have no admittance there. Treatment so harsh and severe from him who had formerly been a fond brother, was beyond measure distressing to the princess; but she behaved with calmness and moderation, for her hope was fixed on heaven. 	40320.0	120	[3, 1, 2, 0]	VALID	1: The Lady Maria goes to the prince's castle with her two children to plead with him, but is turned away. The prince is moved but ultimately does not relent.  2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the events described would take some time to unfold. The Lady Maria would have to travel to the castle, and then wait for the prince to respond to her letter. The prince would have to walk through his castle and then retire to his closet.

When she felt the approach of death, she received the holy sacrament with much devotion. She called to her bed-side the prince Ferdinand her first born, and now only child, and, after leaving with him many pious lessons, she raised herself a little, as if animated with extraordinary life; 'My son, said she, be not cast down. God bless you. God make you a good and an honest man; for riches I despise. Take a sword in your hand, and you may one day be as great a hero as some of your predecessors.' Having thus spoke, she reclined her head with peace and complacency; while Don Ferdinand stood by her like 'the young eaglet of a valiant nest,' Douglas a Tragedy. in an attitude as if already facing all the dangers of the field, and at the same  time touched with the deepest concern for his dying mother, who expired a few minutes after. Don Spiritoso, whose liberality of disposition far exceeded his fortune, was unable to support his son; but a princess of great worth, the friend of lady Maria, took under her protection the young Don Ferdinand, and gave him an education suitable to his real birth. And in whatever way it is, that the qualities of nobility are transmitted, it is certain, that this prince by his sentiments, his manners, and his air, could not but be acknowledged as of superiour rank. His uncle however remained inexorable, and Don Ferdinand never flattered himself with any expectation of happier days. 	6307200.0	10080	[1, 3, 0, 2]	VALID	1: A woman's youngest son dies, and she dies soon after.

246	BoswJDS.txt|9|u	Donna Eleanora appeared at table with such gracefulness and majesty, that the prince often fixed his eyes upon her, and then hastily withdrawing them, was heard to say, 'This  is strange! This is strange!' After dinner she was shewn to her apartment to take a siesto, or gentle sleep, as is the custom in Spain. She dreamed that a lady appeared to her with a celestial countenance, informing her, she was the princess Maria, and saying, 'Noble lady, I am come to tell you, that Donna Eleanora was born for the deliverance of my injured son.' This vision left a wonderful impression on the mind of Donna Eleanora; she wist not well what to think of it. She rose and went to the drawing room, where she found the prince reclined on a sofa, and playing on the lute with inimitable taste; she begged that he would continue his music, of which she was very fond. The prince did so, and touched the instrument with such delicacy, that  Donna Eleanora thought herself in an enchanted region. His airs were mostly melancholy; but he would now and then entertain the lady with a favourite love-song. After this they talked together till supper; and the prince seemed more and more delighted with her conversation. When she retired to her room at night, she could hardly sleep for reflecting on the extraordinary scene of the former day: but how much was she surprized next morning, when, on coming down to breakfast, she found the knight her father sitting with the prince of Dorando. 	2880.0	180	[3, 0, 1, 2]	VALID	1: Donna Eleanora appears at a meal with the prince, takes a nap, has a dream, wakes up, listens to the prince play music, talks with him, and goes to bed.

Donna Eleanora was struck with wonder. The vision came full in her mind; and she adored the benignity of Providence. Then turning to the prince; 'My affections, said she, are no otherways engaged than to this illustrious house. They have long been so engaged; and they are now a thousand times more so since I have seen the representative of the family. Your highness does me an honour which I cannot find words to express. It shall be the study of my life to deserve it.' His highnesses priest was called in to his presence, and the ceremony was immediately performed. Now madam, said the prince, I can show you my gallery  without being afraid of any reproof from you. The news of this marriage flew over the country, and filled every honest heart with joy: but it was like a clap of thunder to the house of Arvidoso. They feared that their hopes were blasted.

248	BoswJDS.txt|11|u	The prince Dorando now resumed in a great measure his former chearfulness. All the nobility around came and paid their court to him: and he found himself as fit for society as ever. He went to Sevile with his princess, and resided a part of the winter. His levee was continually crouded. A celebrated tragedy, in honour of his family, was performed in the  public theatre, where the prince himself appeared amidst the acclamations of the audience. Something was still wanting to render the felicity compleat. The princess Dorando could have wished to have brought the prince a son of his own to take up his succession; but in the mean time she was anxious to undeceive him with regard to his nephew; and when she despaired of her own offspring, she became still more anxious. She took every opportunity of talking to the prince concerning his sister, and she convinced him of the falsity of many of the stories that had been told him. It was now ten years since his nephew's birth, but Donna Justina was still alive in obscure apartments at Sevile. The prince was prevailed with to visit her, and was alone with  her for a considerable time, when he examined her as to the whole affair, with that keen penetration for which he was distinguished. The accounts which he heard from Donna Justina, were so direct, and enforced with such serious and solemn asseverations, while his strict attention made it impossible for her to dissemble, that the prince was much persuaded of his sister's innocence, and of the honour of his nephew. 	80640.0	30240	[2, 1, 0, 3]	VALID	1: The passage describes the prince Dorando's return to his former cheerfulness, his popularity among the nobility, his winter in Seville with his princess, and his visit to his sister Donna Justina, who convinces him of her innocence and the honor of his nephew.  2: The passage doesn't give any explicit reference to time, but it does mention that it has been ten years since the birth of the nephew. The events described in the passage, including the prince's winter in Seville and his visit to Donna Justina, would have taken at least a few weeks. Let's say three weeks.  3: Three weeks have elapsed. At seven days a week that's 21 days. 24 hours in a day, so 504 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 30240 minutes. 4: 30240 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
249	BoswJDS.txt|12|u	He owned this to the princess his consort, who insisted that he was called upon to show his conviction to the world, and to do justice to his injured heir. And when the prince seemed still to hesitate, her eagerness for the young Don Ferdinand would sometimes throw her into transports of passion, which her enemies represented as gross affectation, but which  the prince saw to be real. He therefore committed to the flames his settlements on the house of Arvidoso, and devised his succession to his nephew Don Ferdinand. He was often asked by the princess to see his nephew, but he would not agree to it, crying, 'Ah madam! These wretches These wretches They have planted thorns in my mind, which have taken root for so many years, that I cannot entirely pull them out, without tearing myself to pieces. Let me alone! I cannot bear to think of the subject. It opens afresh the wounds of my heart I have been imposed upon I have been unjust I have been cruel But God knows, my intentions were upright I have made reparation, and my soul shall rest in peace.'  Soon after this, the prince Carlos Dorando died, and was carried in great funeral pomp to the tomb of his ancestors. 	20160.0	40320	[0, 1, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The passage describes the prince's decision to disinherit his own son and instead leave his succession to his nephew, Don Ferdinand. The prince is tormented by his decision and dies soon after. 2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but it does describe a significant change in the prince's attitude and actions, which would have taken some time to develop. Let's say this took a few weeks or months. The prince's death and funeral would have taken a few more days.  3: Let's say four weeks have elapsed. At seven days a week that's 28 days. 24 hours in a day, so 672 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 40320 minutes. 4: 40320 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
250	BoswJDS.txt|13|u	The family of Arvidoso would not yet give over their designs upon the wealth of Dorando. Its prince was then in minority, and he had several guardians of high rank and character, but so extravagantly keen to aggrandize their pupil, that they grasped at a tempting appearance, without perceiving that it was only a bubble raised by the breath of malignity. They fondly wished to commence a process of Partus Suppositio, against Don Ferdinand; and to make enquiries for it, they sent privately to Paris Don Stivalbo, a lawyer, who lay under great obligations to the family of Arvidoso, and was prevailed  with to undertake the ungracious task. Don Stivalbo was a man of principle, and he resolved to conduct himself with the utmost impartiality; but when he arrived at Paris, he was soon surrounded by French priests, advocates, and agents of all kinds, who wished no better than so fat a subject as the domains of Arvidoso and Dorando to feed upon. The gallant Stivalbo understanding little of their language, with true Spanish generosity, trusted to the reports of these gentry; who with many bows, shrugs, and compliments, pretended they had made astonishing discoveries, till Stivalbo had his imagination so warmed, that he himself gave credit to the imposture, and a suit was immediately raised before the senate of Sevile. 	20160.0	20160	[3, 0, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The passage describes the family of Arvidoso's attempts to take the wealth of Dorando, which is in the hands of a minor prince. They send a lawyer to Paris to begin a legal process, which he does, but he is misled by French lawyers and agents who want to profit from the case.  2: The passage describes a lawyer's journey to Paris, his being misled by French lawyers and agents, and the beginning of a legal process. This could take anywhere from a few days to several weeks, depending on how long it took the lawyer to travel to Paris, how long he stayed there, and how long it took to begin the legal process. Let's say two weeks. 3: Two weeks have elapsed. At seven days a week that's 14 days. 24 hours in a day, so 336 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 20160 minutes. 4: 20160 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
251	BoswJDS.txt|14|u	 In the meantime the guardians of Don Ferdinand began to be somewhat apprehensive, knowing that it was not difficult to bring very extraordinary proofs from the Gavaccios, as the Spaniards call the French, whom they detest. The princess dowager was determined to be at the bottom of the affair, and set out herself for Paris, carrying with her several lawyers of great eminence in their profession, and remarkable for their honour as private gentlemen. She had the satisfaction to find, upon a careful enquiry, that the house of Arvidoso had been led a wild-goosechace, and that there was nothing to fear. The Arvidoso party, however, still continued their pursuit, changing their ground, and taking up a variety of different plans; so that the princess  was obliged to make no less than three or four journeys a-cross the Pyrenees, in order to get every new story refuted; and indeed this was easy enough, for no sooner did the priests of Arvidoso conjure up a spectre, than the princess Dorando found priests who as cleverly laid it. Such, however, was the ingenuity of the sharpset emissaries in France, that they contrived to keep the affair afloat for several years, while they were magnificently entertained by both parties, who, according to the Parisian phrase, avoient beaucoup d'esprit, et donnoient bien à manger. 	1576800.0	1607040	[3, 1, 2, 0]	VALID	1: The princess dowager travels to Paris with lawyers to investigate a claim against Don Ferdinand. The Arvidoso party continues to pursue the claim, but the princess is able to refute their stories. The affair continues for several years. 2: The passage describes several journeys across the Pyrenees, which would take at least a few days each. The passage also mentions that the affair continued for several years. Let's say the journeys took a week each, and the affair continued for three years. 3: Three years is 1095 days. Three journeys across the Pyrenees would take 21 days. So, 1095 + 21 = 1116 days. 24 hours in a day, so 26784 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 1607040 minutes. 4: 1607040 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
252	BoswJDS.txt|17|u	We have the continued acknowledgment of parents. We have their positive and dying testimony; with the positive and dying testimony of a woman who was present at the birth of the  defendant. I lay my hand upon my heart, and I judge as I would wish to be judged. Can I then suppose all this to be a complication of guilt, of deliberate and downright perjury? No, signors; I cannot, unless upon a strong proof indeed. And what is the proof that has been brought? These testimonies remain untouched. They are uniform and consistent in the grand point. Upon what then do the plaintiffs rest their extraordinary plea? They have embarked us in a mare magnum of circumstances, picked up at the distance of fourteen years. And I must say, picked up from the streets of Paris, from the very dregs of the French Canaille. It is true, that the defendant has also his ragged evidences; but let us consider who first called in  the lame and the blind. Had not the plaintiffs built, the defendant had not been obliged to pull down. Signors, I am only surprised to see Don Pedro here. I know him, and I regard him; and it has all along been most difficult for me to reconcile the cause and the lawyer; but when I consider how imperceptibly he has been led away, I excuse him; and I here publickly acquit his honour. For my own part, signors, I have no difficulty; and were not the prince of Arvidoso a minor, these plaintiffs should not go without paying costs of suit.' Thus spoke the chief justice, with a warmth of feeling which went to the heart of every spectator. Several of the senators delivered their sentiments in terms a little different, but  to the same purpose with their head; and only one or two remained still under the cloud of prejudice, but did not venture to say one word. 	15.0	30.5	[3, 0, 2, 1]	VALID	1: A chief justice speaks to a group of people, defending the defendant in a legal case. He argues that the defendant's evidence is more reliable than the plaintiffs', which he characterizes as picked up from the streets of Paris. He also praises the defendant's lawyer and acquits the prince of Arvidoso of any wrongdoing. 2: The passage describes a speech, which would have taken some time to deliver. The chief justice also references events that happened 14 years ago, which would have taken some time to unfold. Let's say the speech took 30 minutes to deliver and the events referred to took a year to unfold. 3: 30.5 minutes. Multiplying by 60 minutes in an hour, that's 1830 seconds. 4: 1830 seconds. 5: High confidence.
253	BoswJDS.txt|18|u	The spectators could not contain their joy, but shouted as at a bullfight, or any other of the superb spectacles of Spain. Most of the windows of Sevile were that evening illuminated, and bonefires blazed in every corner of the city, while health and prosperity was drunk to the prince Ferdinand of Dorando. Stung to the quick, the Arvidoso train gnashed their teeth in rage and despair. They however carried their cause by appeal, before the grandees of Spain at Madrid; but it only served to make their desperate scheme fall upon their own heads with redoubled vengeance. That illustrious assembly could hardly hear them  with patience. One of the grandees muttered, that the Arvidoso party had said strong things, that they had a heavy memorial. 'Heavy! cryed the chancellor of Spain, with a violence that made his brother shrink within himself. Heavy! yes it is heavy; but heavy as was chaos,' Nec quicquam, nise pondus iners, congestaque eodem Non bene junctarum discordia semina rerum. An illustrious grandee the greatest minister that Spain ever saw, and whose eloquence vied with that of the orators of Greece and Rome, rose up, and looking around him with a piercing eye he thus began 'Though long accustomed to hold with a steady hand the balance of Europe, and mark the fate of nations; I confess, most mighty signors, that I have at no time been more affected than I now am by  this private question Private, did I say?	4320.0	10080	[0, 3, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The passage describes a celebration in Seville for Prince Ferdinand of Dorando, and the anger of the Arvidoso train, who took their case to the grandees of Spain in Madrid. One grandee speaks eloquently in response. 2: The passage doesn't give any explicit indication of how much time has passed. The events described, however, suggest that at least a few days have passed since the celebration in Seville. The Arvidoso train would have had to travel to Madrid, and then wait for an audience with the grandees. Let's say a week has passed. 3: One week has elapsed. At seven days a week that's 7 days. 24 hours in a day, so 168 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 10080 minutes. 4: 10080 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

No, signors! While my blood is warm, I hope Spain shall never adopt such unjustifiable measures. I speak with more confidence, that upon this occasion, I see not the least doubt. The defendant's honour is cleared from every stain; and as I heartily disapprove of the temerity of the plaintiffs, I think we should award the defendant very large costs of suit, that those who bring such  odious actions before us may see what sort of a reception they are to meet with The court of Sevile has been too indulgent It is true, the prince of Arvidoso is a minor; but let him call his guardians to account when he comes of age. In this great assembly we are moved by no particular considerations we know no private parties our views are enlarged and extensive let our sentence be issued with the proper authority of the grandees of Spain.' The whole assembly, except a very few, unanimously agreed with the eloquent minister and by a great majority it was carried, that the plaintiff should pay 50000 zechins as costs of suit. Thus was the prince Ferdinand of Dorando raised to the illustrious state of which he had been so long deprived. His dignity sat very  easy upon him, for it was natural to him. Envy and malevolene gradually decayed; and even his bitterest enemies began to repent. 	120960.0	10080	[2, 0, 1, 3]	VALID	1: A minister speaks to an assembly in Spain, arguing against a lawsuit that would deprive children of their estate. The assembly agrees with him and awards the defendant large costs of suit. The prince Ferdinand of Dorando is raised to an illustrious state. 2: The events described in the passage are all spoken or thought, so they take place in real time. The minister speaks for a few minutes, and the assembly agrees with him. The prince's enemies begin to repent gradually, so this might take a few days or weeks. Let's say a week. 3: One week has elapsed. At seven days a week that's 7 days x 24 hours in a day, so 168 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 10080 minutes. 4: 10080 minutes. 5: High confidence.
255	BoswJDS.txt|22|u	During the heat and hurry of this adventure, the two princes had totally forgot all family differences; and indeed had hardly time to recollect their own quality. They now stood for a minute and looked at each other, when Arvidoso, with tears of gratitude in his eyes, run up, and throwing himself into the arms of Dorando; 'Generous prince, said he, forgive what is past, I am not to blame; let there be henceforth an everlasting  friendship between us.' Dorando embraced him with equal cordiality and told him 'That he wished for nothing more than what he now had obtained The friendship of so amiable a prince.' In the mean time the attendants of Arvidoso, who had been left far behind, came up. They had been in great apprehensions for their prince. But how were they astonished and confounded, when they saw him with the prince of Dorando! They stopt short and were at a loss what to do. The prince of Arvidoso perceived it, and calling to them to approach, he advanced walking arm in arm with the prince of Dorando, and told his attendants what had happened, saying, 'Gentlemen, you now see my deliverer and best friend.'  The prince of Dorando saluted the company with a graceful ease; and turning to the prince of Arvidoso, 'Sir, said he, your highness has been pleased to call me your friend Let me have a proof that you are in earnest.	5.0	120	[1, 3, 2, 0]	VALID	1: Two princes, Arvidoso and Dorando, have just reconciled after an adventure. Arvidoso's attendants catch up to them and are surprised to see the two princes walking arm in arm.  2: The passage describes a brief moment of reflection and conversation, probably no more than a minute or two.  3: 2 minutes have elapsed.

It was accordingly agreed, and they all went to the castle of Dorando, where they were sumptuously entertained. After supper, when warm a little with wine, the two princes retired to a window, where, after talking a few minutes in private, prince Arvidoso made a sign to Don Pedro to join them. When he came, the prince Arvidoso said to the  prince Dorando, 'Allow me to present to your highness this gentleman, he is worthy of your esteem, and his candour is such, that I have convinced him he was in the wrong to you; for young as I am, I have studied with great application the cause in which both of us were so much concerned; and I give you my word, that I have always declared my opinion, that it was an injurious process. I have only to ask one favour of you, my dear prince, which is, that you may not give my mother as much trouble as our family has given yours.' Dorando assured Don Pedro that he heartily forgave him, and as he knew him to be a man of parts would be glad to show him every mark of his attention. This done, they returned to the table. Dorando  grew exceedingly g y. He gave them several strokes of pleasantry on their famous cause; and turning to Rodomontado, said with a very sly look, ? 'What say you to it, my old Trojan? Will you be tossed from the tower of Toledo now?' From that time foreward, the greatest intimacy subsisted between the two families. The prince of Dorando married a lady of great beauty and merit and continued in dignity and in lustre the race of his ancestors.

I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.  I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is forever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes.	1440.0	10080	[3, 2, 1, 0]	VALID	1: The letter-writer has arrived in St. Petersburg and writes to his sister about his journey so far and his excitement for his upcoming expedition to the North Pole.  2: The letter-writer has already arrived in St. Petersburg, so we can assume that some time has passed since he left England. He mentions walking in the streets of St. Petersburg, which suggests that he has been there for at least a day. He also mentions that he is 'already far north of London,' which could mean a few days of travel. Let's say a week has passed since he left England.  3: One week has elapsed. At seven days a week that's 7 days. 24 hours in a day, so 168 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 10,080 minutes. 4: 10,080 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent forever. I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine. 	70560.0	1051200	[3, 1, 0, 2]	VALID	1: The speaker is describing their excitement about embarking on a voyage of discovery to a land never before visited, and the potential benefits of their discoveries. 2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but it does describe a voyage of discovery to a previously unvisited land, which would likely take several months. Additionally, the speaker mentions the potential benefits of their discoveries to 'the last generation,' implying that the voyage could take years. Let's say the voyage would take two years. 3: 2 years is 730 days. 24 hours in a day, so 17,520 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 1,051,200 minutes. 4: 1,051,200 minutes. 5: Low confidence, as the passage is highly speculative and doesn't provide any concrete details about the voyage.

Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for her weakened frame.  From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained for several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother's tender caresses and my father's smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something better—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me.	7358400.0	259200	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator describes their parents' marriage and travels through Italy, Germany, and France.

The narrator is born in Naples and is an infant during the travels. The passage does not describe how long the travels took, but it seems reasonable to assume that they took at least a few months. Let's say six months.  3: Six months have elapsed. At 30 days a month that's 180 days. 24 hours in a day, so 4320 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 259200 minutes. 4: 259200 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
260	ShelMF.txt|76|u	 M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.  Clerval had never sympathized in my tastes for natural science; and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on the same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of any other country. When you read their writings, life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome! 	788400.0	30240	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator describes how his friend Clerval came to the university to study oriental languages, and how the narrator joined him in those studies. The narrator reflects on how he finds solace in the melancholy and joy of the orientalists' writings. 2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but it does describe a change in the narrator's studies and interests. Let's say that this change took a few weeks to a month to occur. 3: Let's say three weeks have elapsed.

It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he was free last night!'  'I do not know what you mean,' replied my brother, in accents of wonder, 'but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. No one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family, could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?'  'Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?'  'No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried today, and you will then hear all.' 	2.0	10080	[3, 2, 1, 0]	VALID	1: Ernest tells his brother that Justine Moritz has been accused of murder, and that she is very upset about it. Ernest believes that the evidence against her is strong, but Elizabeth, another family member, does not believe that Justine could have committed such a crime. Justine is to be tried that day. 2: The events described in the passage are mostly a conversation, which would take only a few minutes. However, there is a reference to Justine's trial being that day, which implies that some time has passed since the murder. Let's say a week has passed. 3: One week has elapsed.

Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard! Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!  Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair, I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts. 	180.0	1.5	[3, 0, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator reflects on the grief of his family and the destruction he has wrought.  2: The passage is entirely reflective and does not describe any events that would take time. However, even reflection takes a little time. Let's say the narrator spends a minute or two reflecting.  3: 1.5 minutes have elapsed.  4: 1.5 minutes.  5: High confidence.
263	ShelMF.txt|182|u	 'While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. And then I bent over her and whispered, 'Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my beloved, awake!'  'The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me. The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me—not I, but she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am forever robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had its source in her; be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons of Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work mischief. I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled. 	60.0	2	[0, 2, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator, who has committed a murder, enters a barn and sees a young woman sleeping. He contemplates waking her up and speaking to her, but fears she will denounce him as a murderer. He decides to place a portrait in her dress and flee. 2: The events described in the passage are mostly mental and emotional, but the narrator does physically enter the barn and place the portrait in the woman's dress. This would take at least a minute or two.  3: Let's say two minutes have elapsed. 4: 2 minutes. 5: High confidence.
264	ShelMF.txt|185|u	 A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently he calmed himself and proceeded—  'I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for you do not reflect that YOU are the cause of its excess. If any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a hundredfold; for that one creature's sake I would make peace with the whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realized. What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be harmless and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! My creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my request!' 	2.0	180	[1, 0, 2, 3]	VALID	1: A character speaks to his creator, asking for a mate who is as hideous as he is.  2: The passage describes a character's speech, which would take a few minutes to deliver.  3: Let's say three minutes have elapsed. Multiplying by 60 minutes an hour, that's 180 minutes.  4: 180 minutes.  5: High confidence.
265	ShelMF.txt|203|u	 If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness, it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace. But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to my heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish.  But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement. He was also pursuing an object he had long had in view. His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of European colonization and trade. In Britain only could he further the execution of his plan.	110880.0	262810	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator reflects on a journey that would have been pleasurable in the past, but is now only useful for the information it might provide. The narrator finds company irksome and reflects on the barrier between themself and others. The narrator then reflects on their friend Clerval's plans to visit India. 2: The passage describes the narrator's thoughts and reflections, which take time to occur. The passage also describes Clerval's plans, which would require some time to execute. Let's say the narrator's reflections take 10 minutes and Clerval's plans take 6 months. 3: 6 months is 182.5 days. 24 hours in a day, so 4380 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 262800 minutes. Adding 10 minutes for the narrator's reflections, we get 262810 minutes. 4: 262810 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the estimate for Clerval's plans is speculative.

'I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.'  'That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been, can death be any evil to me?'  'Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonizing than the strange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality, seized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across your path.' 	2.0	5	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: A stranger tries to offer comfort to someone who has been charged with murder, but the person is too miserable to be comforted. The stranger describes the unfortunate events that led to the person's current situation. 2: The events described are entirely reflective and conversational, so it's difficult to estimate how much time has passed. Let's say the conversation took five minutes. 3: 5 minutes have elapsed. 4: 5 minutes. 5: High confidence.
267	ShelMF.txt|242|u	    Chapter 22  The voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I could continue my journey. My father's care and attentions were indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to seek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not abhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right to share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whose joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. How they would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!  My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride. 	30240.0	30240	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator and their father land in Paris, but the narrator is too ill to continue their journey. The father tries to cheer the narrator up by suggesting they seek amusement in society, but the narrator feels too guilty about their past actions to interact with other people. 2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but it seems likely that the voyage from wherever they were before to Paris would have taken at least a few days, if not longer. The narrator's illness is also described as something that requires rest, so it's possible that they spend a few days or even weeks in Paris before the father suggests seeking amusement in society. The passage doesn't give a clear indication of how long the narrator avoids society, but it seems like it could be a matter of days or weeks. Given all of this, it seems reasonable to estimate that the events in the passage take place over the course of a few weeks. 3: Let's say three weeks have elapsed. At seven days a week, that's 21 days. 24 hours in a day, so 504 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 30240 minutes. 4: 30240 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
268	ShelMF.txt|255|u	 Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating; joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place to distraction and reverie.  The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. The spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.  The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity, sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay. The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me forever.     Chapter 23  It was eight o'clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines. 	1440.0	180	[0, 1, 3, 2]	VALID	1: Elizabeth and the narrator are traveling by boat and enjoying the scenery. They pass the river Drance and approach the eastern boundary of the lake, where they see the spire of Evian. The wind dies down and they land at eight o'clock, enjoying the scenery for a short time before retiring to an inn. 2: The passage describes a boat ride and a short walk on the shore, which might take an hour or two. There is no explicit reference to time, but the sun setting suggests that it's been at least a few hours since they set out. Let's say three hours. 3: Three hours have elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour, that's 180 minutes. 4: 180 minutes. 5: High confidence.
269	ShelMF.txt|270|u	 I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the daemon generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path. I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed, which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.  My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth's voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends.	45360.0	1440	[2, 1, 0, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator is traveling through a sparsely populated area, avoiding rivers where people gather. He subsists on wild animals and sometimes distributes money or food to villagers. He finds his life miserable except for the moments of happiness he experiences in sleep, when he dreams of his loved ones.  2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but it does describe a series of actions that would take some time: traveling, hunting, distributing money and food, sleeping, and dreaming. Let's say that these actions take place over the course of a day.  3: One day has elapsed. At 24 hours in a day, that's 1440 minutes.  4: 1440 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
270	ShelMF.txt|288|u	 It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was entirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with difficulty and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the meantime he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.  His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient. I sat by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near, said, 'Alas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable. In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and well-being. 	180.0	60	[1, 0, 2, 3]	VALID	1: A man is dying and the narrator is watching over him. The dying man expresses regret that he will not be able to see his enemy die, but says he no longer feels the burning hatred he once did. He reflects on his past conduct, and mentions having created a rational creature. 2: The events described in the passage probably took at least an hour, given the time it takes for the surgeon to arrive and give the man a composing draught. However, there is no explicit reference to time, so it's hard to say for sure. 3: 1 hour. 4: 60 minutes. 5: High confidence.

Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to me, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in death?  'Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness; and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them forever. 	2.0	2628000	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: A character reflects on how they used to find joy in the world, but now only find solace in death due to their crimes and remorse. They say farewell to Frankenstein, who sought their destruction to prevent further harm. 2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but the character reflects on how their feelings have changed over time. Let's say that the character's transformation took several years.  3: Let's say five years have elapsed. At 365 days a year that's 1825 days x 24 hours in a day, so 43800 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 2628000 minutes. 4: 2628000 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the passage is vague and the estimate is based on speculation.

I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus. Farewell.'  He sprang from the cabin window as he said this, upon the ice raft which lay close to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance.   	8.0	1.5	[1, 3, 0, 2]	VALID	1: A man speaks with 'sad and solemn enthusiasm' about his impending death, then jumps out of a cabin window onto an ice raft and is carried away by waves. 2: The man's speech and actions are described in detail, but there is no explicit reference to time.

273	godsofmars.txt|0|u	  FOREWORD   Twelve years had passed since I had laid the body of my great-uncle, Captain John Carter, of Virginia, away from the sight of men in that strange mausoleum in the old cemetery at Richmond.  Often had I pondered on the odd instructions he had left me governing the construction of his mighty tomb, and especially those parts which directed that he be laid in an _open_ casket and that the ponderous mechanism which controlled the bolts of the vault's huge door be accessible _only from the inside_.  Twelve years had passed since I had read the remarkable manuscript of this remarkable man; this man who remembered no childhood and who could not even offer a vague guess as to his age; who was always young and yet who had dandled my grandfather's great-grandfather upon his knee; this man who had spent ten years upon the planet Mars; who had fought for the green men of Barsoom and fought against them; who had fought for and against the red men and who had won the ever beautiful Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium, for his wife, and for nearly ten years had been a prince of the house of Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium. 	6307200.0	10080	[3, 2, 1, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator reflects on the passing of twelve years since his great-uncle's death and the odd instructions he left for his tomb. He also reflects on the remarkable life of his great-uncle, who spent ten years on Mars and fought for and against various Martian factions.  2: The passage is mostly reflective and doesn't describe any specific events, but it does mention that twelve years have passed since the narrator's great-uncle's death. It's unclear how long it took the narrator to read his great-uncle's manuscript, but let's assume it took a few days to a week.  3: Let's say a week has elapsed. At seven days a week that's 7 days x 24 hours in a day, so 168 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 10,080 minutes.  4: 10,080 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
274	godsofmars.txt|1|u	 Twelve years had passed since his body had been found upon the bluff before his cottage overlooking the Hudson, and oft-times during these long years I had wondered if John Carter were really dead, or if he again roamed the dead sea bottoms of that dying planet; if he had returned to Barsoom to find that he had opened the frowning portals of the mighty atmosphere plant in time to save the countless millions who were dying of asphyxiation on that far-gone day that had seen him hurtled ruthlessly through forty-eight million miles of space back to Earth once more. I had wondered if he had found his black-haired Princess and the slender son he had dreamed was with her in the royal gardens of Tardos Mors, awaiting his return.  Or, had he found that he had been too late, and thus gone back to a living death upon a dead world? Or was he really dead after all, never to return either to his mother Earth or his beloved Mars?  Thus was I lost in useless speculation one sultry August evening when old Ben, my body servant, handed me a telegram. Tearing it open I read:   'Meet me to-morrow hotel Raleigh Richmond.  'JOHN CARTER'   Early the next morning I took the first train for Richmond and within two hours was being ushered into the room occupied by John Carter. 	6307200.0	180	[0, 1, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator reflects on the possibility of John Carter's survival and return to Earth or Mars, and then receives a telegram from John Carter asking to meet in Richmond. The narrator takes the first train to Richmond and meets John Carter there.  2: The narrator reflects on a period of twelve years, but the events of the passage itself take place over a single day. The narrator receives a telegram and takes the first train to Richmond, which would take at least a few hours. Let's say three hours.  3: Three hours have elapsed. 60 minutes in an hour, so 180 minutes. 4: 180 minutes. 5: High confidence.
275	godsofmars.txt|9|u	The wood of some of the trees was as black as ebony, while their nearest neighbours might perhaps gleam in the subdued light of the forest as clear and white as the finest china, or, again, they were azure, scarlet, yellow, or deepest purple.  And in the same way was the foliage as gay and variegated as the stems, while the blooms that clustered thick upon them may not be described in any earthly tongue, and indeed might challenge the language of the gods.  As I neared the confines of the forest I beheld before me and between the grove and the open sea, a broad expanse of meadow land, and as I was about to emerge from the shadows of the trees a sight met my eyes that banished all romantic and poetic reflection upon the beauties of the strange landscape.  To my left the sea extended as far as the eye could reach, before me only a vague, dim line indicated its further shore, while at my right a mighty river, broad, placid, and majestic, flowed between scarlet banks to empty into the quiet sea before me.  At a little distance up the river rose mighty perpendicular bluffs, from the very base of which the great river seemed to rise.  But it was not these inspiring and magnificent evidences of Nature's grandeur that took my immediate attention from the beauties of the forest. It was the sight of a score of figures moving slowly about the meadow near the bank of the mighty river. 	30.0	2700	[3, 2, 1, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator describes a forest with trees of various colors and foliage, and then emerges to see a meadow with a river and bluffs. They see figures moving in the meadow.  2: The passage describes a transition from a forest to a meadow, which would take some time to traverse. The narrator also takes time to reflect on the beauty of the forest before being distracted by the figures in the meadow. Let's say 30 minutes to an hour.  3: 45 minutes have elapsed. Multiplying by 60 minutes an hour that's 2700 minutes. 4: 2700 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
276	godsofmars.txt|18|u	 As I had watched the noble fight which the great warrior had put up against such enormous odds my heart had swelled in admiration for him, and acting as I am wont to do, more upon impulse than after mature deliberation, I instantly sprang from my sheltering rock and bounded quickly toward the bodies of the dead green Martians, a well-defined plan of action already formed.  Half a dozen great leaps brought me to the spot, and another instant saw me again in my stride in quick pursuit of the hideous monsters that were rapidly gaining on the fleeing warrior, but this time I grasped a mighty long-sword in my hand and in my heart was the old blood lust of the fighting man, and a red mist swam before my eyes and I felt my lips respond to my heart in the old smile that has ever marked me in the midst of the joy of battle.  Swift as I was I was none too soon, for the green warrior had been overtaken ere he had made half the distance to the forest, and now he stood with his back to a boulder, while the herd, temporarily balked, hissed and screeched about him.  With their single eyes in the centre of their heads and every eye turned upon their prey, they did not note my soundless approach, so that I was upon them with my great long-sword and four of them lay dead ere they knew that I was among them. 	1.0	300	[2, 3, 1, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator watches a warrior fight against monsters, then leaps to the warrior's aid and kills four of the monsters with a sword.  2: The narrator's leap and subsequent killing of the monsters would have taken a few seconds, but the passage also describes the narrator's admiration for the warrior and the narrator's 'well-defined plan of action,' which would have taken some time to form. Let's say five minutes.  3: 5 minutes have elapsed. Multiplying by 60 minutes an hour that's 300 minutes. 4: 300 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

Scarcely had it started than I gave the signal to Tars Tarkas, simultaneously springing for the receding half of the pivoting door. In like manner the Thark wheeled and leaped for the opening being made by the inswinging section.  A single bound carried me completely through into the adjoining room and brought me face to face with the fellow whose cruel face I had seen before. He was about my own height and well muscled and in every outward detail moulded precisely as are Earth men.  At his side hung a long-sword, a short-sword, a dagger, and one of the destructive radium revolvers that are common upon Mars.  The fact that I was armed only with a long-sword, and so according to the laws and ethics of battle everywhere upon Barsoom should only have been met with a similar or lesser weapon, seemed to have no effect upon the moral sense of my enemy, for he whipped out his revolver ere I scarce had touched the floor by his side, but an uppercut from my long-sword sent it flying from his grasp before he could discharge it.  Instantly he drew his long-sword, and thus evenly armed we set to in earnest for one of the closest battles I ever have fought.  The fellow was a marvellous swordsman and evidently in practice, while I had not gripped the hilt of a sword for ten long years before that morning. 	2.0	300	[2, 3, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The protagonist and Tars Tarkas enter a room and engage in a sword fight with an enemy who is armed with a revolver and multiple swords. The enemy is a skilled swordsman and the protagonist has not used a sword in ten years. 2: The passage does not give an explicit reference to time, but the events described would take at least a few minutes. The protagonist and Tars Tarkas would need to wait for the golden surface to move, then make their move through the pivoting door. The fight itself would take some time, as the enemy is a skilled swordsman and the protagonist has not used a sword in ten years. Let's estimate five minutes. 3: 5 minutes have elapsed. Multiplying by 60 minutes in an hour, that's 300 minutes. 4: 300 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

It must now be nearly sundown again. Come, we will go to some nearby window in the cliff and make sure.'  So saying, she led the way through winding corridors until at a sudden turn we came upon an opening which overlooked the Valley Dor.  At our right the sun was setting, a huge red orb, below the western range of Otz. A little below us stood the Holy Thern on watch upon his balcony. His scarlet robe of office was pulled tightly about him in anticipation of the cold that comes so suddenly with darkness as the sun sets. So rare is the atmosphere of Mars that it absorbs very little heat from the sun. During the daylight hours it is always extremely hot; at night it is intensely cold. Nor does the thin atmosphere refract the sun's rays or diffuse its light as upon Earth. There is no twilight on Mars. When the great orb of day disappears beneath the horizon the effect is precisely as that of the extinguishing of a single lamp within a chamber. From brilliant light you are plunged without warning into utter darkness. Then the moons come; the mysterious, magic moons of Mars, hurtling like monster meteors low across the face of the planet. 	4.0	5	[3, 1, 0, 2]	VALID	1: Thuvia and the narrator reach a window in a cliff and observe the sunset on Mars. The passage also describes the atmosphere of Mars. 2: The passage describes the events of one evening on Mars. Thuvia and the narrator reach the storeroom two hours after midnight, and Thuvia says that the narrator slept for fourteen hours. They then go to a window to observe the sunset. The passage doesn't describe any other events, so we can assume that the observation of the sunset is the only thing that happens. The observation of the sunset would take a few minutes.  3: Let's say that the observation of the sunset takes five minutes.  4: 5 minutes. 5: High confidence.

Gradually his contortions became spasmodic, lessening by degrees until they ceased entirely. Then I released my hold upon him and in an instant he was swallowed by the black shadows far below.  Again I climbed to the ship's rail. This time I succeeded in raising my eyes to the level of the deck, where I could take a careful survey of the conditions immediately confronting me.  The nearer moon had passed below the horizon, but the clear effulgence of the further satellite bathed the deck of the cruiser, bringing into sharp relief the bodies of six or eight black men sprawled about in sleep.  Huddled close to the base of a rapid fire gun was a young white girl, securely bound. Her eyes were widespread in an expression of horrified anticipation and fixed directly upon me as I came in sight above the edge of the deck.  Unutterable relief instantly filled them as they fell upon the mystic jewel which sparkled in the centre of my stolen headpiece. She did not speak. Instead her eyes warned me to beware the sleeping figures that surrounded her.  Noiselessly I gained the deck. The girl nodded to me to approach her. As I bent low she whispered to me to release her. 	2.0	5	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The protagonist struggles with someone who is trying to pull him down a chain. The other person stops struggling and falls into the shadows below. The protagonist climbs up to the deck of a cruiser and sees a group of sleeping black men and a white girl who is bound. The girl sees the protagonist's headpiece and signals for him to approach her. She whispers to him to release her. 2: The events described in the passage would have taken at least a few minutes. The struggle with the other person, climbing up to the deck, and surveying the conditions on the cruiser would have taken some time. The girl's reaction to the protagonist's headpiece suggests that he has been wearing it for some time, so we can assume that he has been on the cruiser for at least a few minutes.  3: Let's say five minutes have elapsed. 4: 5 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
280	godsofmars.txt|171|u	 The racks that stood without were stripped of the swords with which the prisoners were to have been armed to enter their allotted combats, and a swarm of determined warriors sped to our support.  The great apes, towering in all their fifteen feet of height, had gone down before my sword while the charging guards were still some distance away. Close behind them pursued the youth. At my back were the young girls, and as it was in their service that I fought, I remained standing there to meet my inevitable death, but with the determination to give such an account of myself as would long be remembered in the land of the First Born.  I noted the marvellous speed of the young red man as he raced after the guards. Never had I seen such speed in any Martian. His leaps and bounds were little short of those which my earthly muscles had produced to create such awe and respect on the part of the green Martians into whose hands I had fallen on that long-gone day that had seen my first advent upon Mars.  The guards had not reached me when he fell upon them from the rear, and as they turned, thinking from the fierceness of his onslaught that a dozen were attacking them, I rushed them from my side. 	1.0	10	[2, 1, 0, 3]	VALID	1: The protagonist fights off some great apes and guards, with the help of a young red man who arrives just in time to help.  2: The passage describes a fight scene, which would take only a few minutes. However, there is also some reflection on the protagonist's part about the young red man's speed and his own past experiences on Mars. Let's say the whole thing takes 10 minutes.  3: 10 minutes have elapsed. 4: 10 minutes. 5: High confidence.
281	godsofmars.txt|204|u	The cruiser, already tilted at a perilous angle, was carried completely over backward by the impact of my smaller vessel. Her crew fell twisting and screaming through the air to the water far below, while the cruiser, her propellers still madly churning, dived swiftly headforemost after them to the bottom of the Sea of Omean.  The collision crushed our steel bows, and notwithstanding every effort on our part came near to hurling us from the deck. As it was we landed in a wildly clutching heap at the very extremity of the flier, where Xodar and I succeeded in grasping the hand-rail, but the boy would have plunged overboard had I not fortunately grasped his ankle as he was already partially over.  Unguided, our vessel careened wildly in its mad flight, rising ever nearer the rocks above. It took but an instant, however, for me to regain the levers, and with the roof barely fifty feet above I turned her nose once more into the horizontal plane and headed her again for the black mouth of the shaft.  The collision had retarded our progress and now a hundred swift scouts were close upon us. Xodar had told me that ascending the shaft by virtue of our repulsive rays alone would give our enemies their best chance to overtake us, since our propellers would be idle and in rising we would be outclassed by many of our pursuers. The swifter craft are seldom equipped with large buoyancy tanks, since the added bulk of them tends to reduce a vessel's speed. 	2.0	60	[3, 0, 1, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator describes a collision between two vessels, the sinking of one, and the near-miss of the other. The narrator then explains that the vessel is being pursued by a hundred scouts. 2: The collision and its aftermath are described in detail, but it's unclear how long the pursuit has been going on. Let's say the pursuit has been going on for an hour.  3: One hour has elapsed. 60 minutes in an hour, so 60 minutes. 4: 60 minutes. 5: High confidence.
282	godsofmars.txt|208|u	 I said as much to Xodar, over my shoulder.  'It is very wonderful, nevertheless,' he replied. 'No one else could have accomplished it but John Carter.'  At the sound of that name the boy jumped to his feet.  'John Carter!' he cried. 'John Carter! Why, man, John Carter, Prince of Helium, has been dead for years. I am his son.'     CHAPTER XIV  THE EYES IN THE DARK   My son! I could not believe my ears. Slowly I rose and faced the handsome youth. Now that I looked at him closely I commenced to see why his face and personality had attracted me so strongly. There was much of his mother's incomparable beauty in his clear-cut features, but it was strongly masculine beauty, and his grey eyes and the expression of them were mine.  The boy stood facing me, half hope and half uncertainty in his look.  'Tell me of your mother,' I said. 'Tell me all you can of the years that I have been robbed by a relentless fate of her dear companionship.'  With a cry of pleasure he sprang toward me and threw his arms about my neck, and for a brief moment as I held my boy close to me the tears welled to my eyes and I was like to have choked after the manner of some maudlin fool--but I do not regret it, nor am I ashamed. A long life has taught me that a man may seem weak where women and children are concerned and yet be anything but a weakling in the sterner avenues of life. 	1.0	5	[2, 3, 1, 0]	VALID	1: The protagonist and Xodar are discussing something wonderful when a boy jumps up and says he is John Carter's son. The protagonist embraces the boy and asks about his mother.  2: The events of the passage are mostly dialogue and description, but the protagonist embraces the boy for a brief moment, which might take a few seconds. The dialogue and description might take a few minutes.  3: Let's say five minutes have elapsed.  4: 5 minutes.  5: High confidence.
283	godsofmars.txt|228|u	 At that moment I caught another glimpse from the corner of my eye of the single pair of eyes at my back making a sudden rush upon me. I turned to meet the charge; there was a quick rush of the three from the other direction; but I determined to pursue the single pair until I should have at least settled my account with one of the beasts and thus be relieved of the strain of meeting attacks from both directions.  There was no sound in the corridor, only that of my own breathing, yet I knew that those three uncanny creatures were almost upon me. The eyes in front were not retreating so rapidly now; I was almost within sword reach of them. I raised my sword arm to deal the blow that should free me, and then I felt a heavy body upon my back. A cold, moist, slimy something fastened itself upon my throat. I stumbled and went down.     CHAPTER XV  FLIGHT AND PURSUIT   I could not have been unconscious more than a few seconds, and yet I know that I was unconscious, for the next thing I realized was that a growing radiance was illuminating the corridor about me and the eyes were gone.  I was unharmed except for a slight bruise upon my forehead where it had struck the stone flagging as I fell. 	1.0	2.0	[2, 3, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The protagonist is attacked by three creatures in a corridor. He decides to focus on the single pair of eyes behind him, but is then attacked from behind and falls unconscious. When he wakes up, the creatures are gone and he has a bruise on his forehead. 2: The protagonist's decision to focus on one attacker and his subsequent attack probably took less than a minute. Falling unconscious and waking up again might have taken a few minutes. Let's say two minutes in total. 3: Two minutes have elapsed. Multiplying by 60 seconds in a minute, that's 120 seconds. 4: 120 seconds. 5: High confidence.
284	godsofmars.txt|234|u	 'Yes. I found him in the prison of Shador, on the Sea of Omean, in the land of the First Born.'  'I know not any of these places, John Carter. Be they upon Barsoom?'  'Upon and below, my friend; but wait until we shall have made good our escape, and you shall hear the strangest narrative that ever a Barsoomian of the outer world gave ear to. Now we must steal our thoats and be well away to the north before these fellows discover how we have tricked them.'  In safety we reached the great gates at the far end of the courtyard, through which it was necessary to take our thoats to the avenue beyond. It is no easy matter to handle five of these great, fierce beasts, which by nature are as wild and ferocious as their masters and held in subjection by cruelty and brute force alone.  As we approached them they sniffed our unfamiliar scent and with squeals of rage circled about us. Their long, massive necks upreared raised their great, gaping mouths high above our heads. They are fearsome appearing brutes at best, but when they are aroused they are fully as dangerous as they look. The thoat stands a good ten feet at the shoulder. His hide is sleek and hairless, and of a dark slate colour on back and sides, shading down his eight legs to a vivid yellow at the huge, padded, nailless feet; the belly is pure white. A broad, flat tail, larger at the tip than at the root, completes the picture of this ferocious green Martian mount--a fit war steed for these warlike people. 	3.0	10	[2, 3, 1, 0]	VALID	1: John Carter and a friend escape from a prison in Shador, on the Sea of Omean, in the land of the First Born. They must steal thoats (large, fierce beasts) to make their escape. The passage describes the appearance of the thoats in detail. 2: The passage describes the escape and the appearance of the thoats in detail, but doesn't give any explicit reference to time. Let's say that the escape and the description of the thoats takes about 10 minutes. 3: 10 minutes have elapsed. 4: 10 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
285	godsofmars.txt|280|u	 'John Carter,' he said, 'by the edict of custom, by the law of our religion, and by the verdict of an impartial court, you are condemned to die. The people cannot save you--I alone may accomplish that. You are absolutely in my power to do with as I wish--I may kill you, or I may free you, and should I elect to kill you, none would be the wiser.  'Should you go free in Helium for a year, in accordance with the conditions of your reprieve, there is little fear that the people would ever insist upon the execution of the sentence imposed upon you.  'You may go free within two minutes, upon one condition. Tardos Mors will never return to Helium. Neither will Mors Kajak, nor Dejah Thoris. Helium must select a new Jeddak within the year. Zat Arrras would be Jeddak of Helium. Say that you will espouse my cause. This is the price of your freedom. I am done.'  I knew it was within the scope of Zat Arrras' cruel heart to destroy me, and if I were dead I could see little reason to doubt that he might easily become Jeddak of Helium. Free, I could prosecute the search for Dejah Thoris. Were I dead, my brave comrades might not be able to carry out our plans. So, by refusing to accede to his request, it was quite probable that not only would I not prevent him from becoming Jeddak of Helium, but that I would be the means of sealing Dejah Thoris' fate--of consigning her, through my refusal, to the horrors of the arena of Issus. 	1.0	300	[2, 1, 3, 0]	VALID	1: John Carter is condemned to die, but Zat Arrras offers him a chance to live if he agrees to support Zat Arrras' bid to become Jeddak of Helium. John Carter weighs the risks of refusing. 2: The passage describes a conversation, which would take a few minutes. There is also a reference to a year-long reprieve, but that time has not yet elapsed. Let's say five minutes. 3: Five minutes have elapsed. Multiplying by 60 minutes an hour that's 300 minutes. 4: 300 minutes. 5: High confidence.
286	godsofmars.txt|281|u	 For a moment I was perplexed, but for a moment only. The proud daughter of a thousand Jeddaks would choose death to a dishonorable alliance such as this, nor could John Carter do less for Helium than his Princess would do.  Then I turned to Zat Arrras.  'There can be no alliance,' I said, 'between a traitor to Helium and a prince of the House of Tardos Mors. I do not believe, Zat Arrras, that the great Jeddak is dead.'  Zat Arrras shrugged his shoulders.  'It will not be long, John Carter,' he said, 'that your opinions will be of interest even to yourself, so make the best of them while you can. Zat Arrras will permit you in due time to reflect further upon the magnanimous offer he has made you. Into the silence and darkness of the pits you will enter upon your reflection this night with the knowledge that should you fail within a reasonable time to agree to the alternative which has been offered you, never shall you emerge from the darkness and the silence again. Nor shall you know at what minute the hand will reach out through the darkness and the silence with the keen dagger that shall rob you of your last chance to win again the warmth and the freedom and joyousness of the outer world.'  Zat Arrras clapped his hands as he ceased speaking. The guards returned. 	1.0	5	[3, 1, 0, 2]	VALID	1: John Carter refuses an alliance with Zat Arrras, who threatens him with death if he doesn't agree to the alternative offered. Guards return. 2: The events described are mostly dialogue and action, with little description of time passing. However, the dialogue suggests that the conversation takes at least a few minutes. The guards' return might take a few more minutes. Let's say five minutes total. 3: 5 minutes have elapsed. 4: 5 minutes. 5: High confidence.
287	godsofmars.txt|343|u	And as she finished speaking I saw her raise a dagger on high, and then I saw another figure. It was Thuvia's. As the dagger fell toward the unprotected breast of my love, Thuvia was almost between them. A blinding gust of smoke blotted out the tragedy within that fearsome cell--a shriek rang out, a single shriek, as the dagger fell.The smoke cleared away, but we stood gazing upon a blank wall. The last crevice had closed, and for a long year that hideous chamber would retain its secret from the eyes of men. They urged me to leave.	1.4	180	[3, 1, 0, 2]	VALID	1: The passage describes a dramatic event in which a woman raises a dagger and another figure intervenes, followed by a blinding gust of smoke and a single shriek. When the smoke clears, the chamber is blank and the crevice has closed. The narrator is urged to leave. 2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the events described would take at least a few minutes. The smoke would need to clear, and the narrator would need to be urged to leave. Let's say three minutes. 3: Three minutes have elapsed. Multiplying by 60 minutes in an hour, that's 180 minutes. 4: 180 minutes. 5: High confidence.

When they carry her dear body from that terrible place a year hence let them find the body of her lord awaiting her.'  Of what happened after that I have only a confused recollection. It seems as though I struggled with many men, and then that I was picked bodily from the ground and borne away. I do not know. I have never asked, nor has any other who was there that day intruded on my sorrow or recalled to my mind the occurrences which they know could but at best reopen the terrible wound within my heart.  Ah! If I could but know one thing, what a burden of suspense would be lifted from my shoulders! But whether the assassin's dagger reached one fair bosom or another, only time will divulge. 	10.0	10	[0, 1, 2, 3]	VALID	1: The speaker urges others to leave him to die beside his Princess. He then has a confused recollection of struggling with many men and being carried away. He reflects on his sorrow and the uncertainty of whether his Princess or he was killed. 2: The events described are brief and chaotic, but the speaker does reflect on his sorrow and the uncertainty of whether his Princess or he was killed. Let's say that the events described took five minutes, and that the speaker's reflections took another five minutes. 3: 10 minutes have elapsed.  4: 10 minutes. 5: High confidence.
289	tomjones.txt|0|u	 THE HISTORY OF TOM JONES, A FOUNDLING.     BOOK I.  CONTAINING AS MUCH OF THE BIRTH OF THE FOUNDLING AS IS NECESSARY OR PROPER TO ACQUAINT THE READER WITH IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS HISTORY.    Chapter i.  The introduction to the work, or bill of fare to the feast.   An author ought to consider himself, not as a gentleman who gives a private or eleemosynary treat, but rather as one who keeps a public ordinary, at which all persons are welcome for their money. In the former case, it is well known that the entertainer provides what fare he pleases; and though this should be very indifferent, and utterly disagreeable to the taste of his company, they must not find any fault; nay, on the contrary, good breeding forces them outwardly to approve and to commend whatever is set before them. Now the contrary of this happens to the master of an ordinary. Men who pay for what they eat will insist on gratifying their palates, however nice and whimsical these may prove; and if everything is not agreeable to their taste, will challenge a right to censure, to abuse, and to d--n their dinner without controul.  To prevent, therefore, giving offence to their customers by any such disappointment, it hath been usual with the honest and well-meaning host to provide a bill of fare which all persons may peruse at their first entrance into the house; and having thence acquainted themselves with the entertainment which they may expect, may either stay and regale with what is provided for them, or may depart to some other ordinary better accommodated to their taste. 	0	2	[0, 3, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The passage is an introduction to the book, in which the author compares himself to a host of a public eating house. He explains that his readers will know what to expect from the book, and can choose to read it or not. 2: The passage is entirely reflective and does not describe any events. However, the author does describe the practice of providing a bill of fare to customers, which would take a few minutes to read. Let's say two minutes. 3: Two minutes have elapsed. 4: 2 minutes. 5: High confidence.
290	tomjones.txt|1|u	 As we do not disdain to borrow wit or wisdom from any man who is capable of lending us either, we have condescended to take a hint from these honest victuallers, and shall prefix not only a general bill of fare to our whole entertainment, but shall likewise give the reader particular bills to every course which is to be served up in this and the ensuing volumes.  The provision, then, which we have here made is no other than _Human Nature_. Nor do I fear that my sensible reader, though most luxurious in his taste, will start, cavil, or be offended, because I have named but one article. The tortoise--as the alderman of Bristol, well learned in eating, knows by much experience--besides the delicious calipash and calipee, contains many different kinds of food; nor can the learned reader be ignorant, that in human nature, though here collected under one general name, is such prodigious variety, that a cook will have sooner gone through all the several species of animal and vegetable food in the world, than an author will be able to exhaust so extensive a subject.  An objection may perhaps be apprehended from the more delicate, that this dish is too common and vulgar; for what else is the subject of all the romances, novels, plays, and poems, with which the stalls abound? Many exquisite viands might be rejected by the epicure, if it was a sufficient cause for his contemning of them as common and vulgar, that something was to be found in the most paltry alleys under the same name. In reality, true nature is as difficult to be met with in authors, as the Bayonne ham, or Bologna sausage, is to be found in the shops. 	0	1576800	[1, 0, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The author explains that they will be writing about human nature, and compares it to a dish with many different kinds of food. They anticipate that some readers might find the subject too common and vulgar. 2: The passage is mostly reflective and explanatory, but the author does mention that they will be writing about human nature in this and the following volumes. This implies that the events of the story will take place over multiple volumes, which could take years to write and publish. Let's say three years. 3: 3 years have elapsed. At 365 days a year that's 1095 days. 24 hours in a day, so 26280 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 1576800 minutes. 4: 1576800 minutes. 5: Low confidence, since the passage is mostly reflective and doesn't describe any specific events.
291	tomjones.txt|38|u	 These calumnies might have probably produced ill consequences, at the least might have occasioned some trouble, to a person of a more doubtful and suspicious character than Mr Allworthy was blessed with; but in his case they had no such effect; and, being heartily despised by him, they served only to afford an innocent amusement to the good gossips of the neighbourhood.  But as we cannot possibly divine what complection our reader may be of, and as it will be some time before he will hear any more of Jenny, we think proper to give him a very early intimation, that Mr Allworthy was, and will hereafter appear to be, absolutely innocent of any criminal intention whatever. He had indeed committed no other than an error in politics, by tempering justice with mercy, and by refusing to gratify the good-natured disposition of the mob,[*] with an object for their compassion to work on in the person of poor Jenny, whom, in order to pity, they desired to have seen sacrificed to ruin and infamy, by a shameful correction in Bridewell.   [*]Whenever this word occurs in our writings, it intends persons  without virtue or sense, in all stations; and many of the highest  rank are often meant by it. 	30240.0	5	[1, 0, 2, 3]	VALID	1: The passage explains that Mr. Allworthy has been the subject of false rumors, but that he is innocent of any wrongdoing.  2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the passage does involve a series of events: the rumors, Mr. Allworthy's reaction, and the author's clarification. These events would have taken at least a few minutes to unfold.  3: Let's say that the events described took 5 minutes.  4: 5 minutes.  5: High confidence.
292	tomjones.txt|62|u	The writer, indeed, seems to think himself obliged to keep even pace with time, whose amanuensis he is; and, like his master, travels as slowly through centuries of monkish dulness, when the world seems to have been asleep, as through that bright and busy age so nobly distinguished by the excellent Latin poet--     _Ad confligendum venientibus undique poenis,    Omnia cum belli trepido concussa tumultu    Horrida contremuere sub altis aetheris auris;    In dubioque fuit sub utrorum regna cadendum    Omnibus humanis esset, terraque marique._  Of which we wish we could give our readers a more adequate translation than that by Mr Creech--     When dreadful Carthage frighted Rome with arms,    And all the world was shook with fierce alarms;    Whilst undecided yet, which part should fall,    Which nation rise the glorious lord of all.  Now it is our purpose, in the ensuing pages, to pursue a contrary method. When any extraordinary scene presents itself (as we trust will often be the case), we shall spare no pains nor paper to open it at large to our reader; but if whole years should pass without producing anything worthy his notice, we shall not be afraid of a chasm in our history; but shall hasten on to matters of consequence, and leave such periods of time totally unobserved. 	0	262800000	[0, 2, 1, 3]	VALID	1: The passage is a reflection on the role of the writer in recording history, and the decision to focus on significant events rather than recording everything. 2: The passage doesn't describe any specific events, but the writer does mention traveling through centuries of history. Let's say the writer is reflecting on a period of 500 years.  3: 500 years have elapsed. At 365 days a year that's 182500 days x 24 hours in a day, so 4380000 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 262800000 minutes! 4: 262800000 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the passage is more about the writer's philosophy than any specific events.

This good woman was, no more than Othello, of a disposition        To make a life of jealousy    And follow still the changes of the moon    With fresh suspicions--  With her, as well as him,       --To be once in doubt,    Was once to be resolvd--  she therefore ordered Jenny immediately to pack up her alls and begone, for that she was determined she should not sleep that night within her walls. 	10.0	0.5	[2, 1, 0, 3]	VALID	1: A woman threatens her husband with a knife, and the maid runs away. The husband does not intervene. The woman then orders the maid to leave. 2: The events described in the passage are brief and happen in quick succession. It might take a few seconds for the maid to run away and for the woman to order her to leave, but not much more than that.  3: Let's say 30 seconds have elapsed.  4: 30 seconds. 5: High confidence.
294	tomjones.txt|401|u	 Jones acquainted the gamekeeper with his loss, and he as readily went back with him to the brook, where they searched every tuft of grass in the meadow, as well where Jones had not been as where he had been; but all to no purpose, for they found nothing; for, indeed, though the things were then in the meadow, they omitted to search the only place where they were deposited; to wit, in the pockets of the said George; for he had just before found them, and being luckily apprized of their value, had very carefully put them up for his own use.  The gamekeeper having exerted as much diligence in quest of the lost goods, as if he had hoped to find them, desired Mr Jones to recollect if he had been in no other place: 'For sure,' said he, 'if you had lost them here so lately, the things must have been here still; for this is a very unlikely place for any one to pass by.' And indeed it was by great accident that he himself had passed through that field, in order to lay wires for hares, with which he was to supply a poulterer at Bath the next morning.  Jones now gave over all hopes of recovering his loss, and almost all thoughts concerning it, and turning to Black George, asked him earnestly if he would do him the greatest favour in the world? 	25.0	60	[2, 1, 3, 0]	VALID	1: Jones loses some items and searches for them with a gamekeeper, but they don't find them. Jones then turns to Black George and asks him for a favor. 2: The passage doesn't give any explicit reference to time, but it does describe a search of a meadow and a conversation. These events would take at least an hour.  3: One hour has elapsed. Multiplying by 60 minutes an hour that's 60 minutes. 4: 60 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
295	tomjones.txt|483|u	  The lieutenant, whom we mentioned in the preceding chapter, and who commanded this party, was now near sixty years of age. He had entered very young into the army, and had served in the capacity of an ensign at the battle of Tannieres; here he had received two wounds, and had so well distinguished himself, that he was by the Duke of Marlborough advanced to be a lieutenant, immediately after that battle.  In this commission he had continued ever since, viz., near forty years; during which time he had seen vast numbers preferred over his head, and had now the mortification to be commanded by boys, whose fathers were at nurse when he first entered into the service.  Nor was this ill success in his profession solely owing to his having no friends among the men in power. He had the misfortune to incur the displeasure of his colonel, who for many years continued in the command of this regiment. Nor did he owe the implacable ill-will which this man bore him to any neglect or deficiency as an officer, nor indeed to any fault in himself; but solely to the indiscretion of his wife, who was a very beautiful woman, and who, though she was remarkably fond of her husband, would not purchase his preferment at the expense of certain favours which the colonel required of her. 	21024000.0	21024000	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The passage describes the career of a lieutenant who has served in the army for nearly forty years, but has been passed over for promotion. The reason for this is that he has incurred the displeasure of his colonel, who bears him ill-will because the lieutenant's wife refused to sleep with him. 2: The passage doesn't describe any specific events, but rather the lieutenant's long career and the reason for his lack of promotion. Let's say that the time required for the lieutenant to have served in the army for nearly forty years, and for his wife to have refused the colonel's advances, is at least 40 years. 3: 40 years have elapsed. At 365 days a year that's 14600 days x 24 hours in a day, so 350400 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 21024000 minutes. 4: 21024000 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the estimate is based on a guess about the length of the lieutenant's career and the duration of his wife's refusal.

Susan departed, and soon returned with an account that the two gentlemen were got both into the same bed. 'Two gentlemen,' says the landlady, 'in the same bed! that's impossible; they are two arrant scrubs, I warrant them; and I believe young Squire Allworthy guessed right, that the fellow intended to rob her ladyship; for, if he had broke open the lady's door with any of the wicked designs of a gentleman, he would never have sneaked away to another room to save the expense of a supper and a bed to himself. They are certainly thieves, and their searching after a wife is nothing but a pretence.'  In these censures my landlady did Mr Fitzpatrick great injustice; for he was really born a gentleman, though not worth a groat; and though, perhaps, he had some few blemishes in his heart as well as in his head, yet being a sneaking or a niggardly fellow was not one of them. In reality, he was so generous a man, that, whereas he had received a very handsome fortune with his wife, he had now spent every penny of it, except some little pittance which was settled upon her; and, in order to possess himself of this, he had used her with such cruelty, that, together with his jealousy, which was of the bitterest kind, it had forced the poor woman to run away from him. 	2628000.0	3	[0, 2, 1, 3]	VALID	1: A landlady and her servant, Susan, discuss two gentlemen who have taken a room together. The landlady suspects them of being thieves and criticizes them for sharing a bed. She also maligns one of the men, Mr. Fitzpatrick, who she believes is searching for a wife only as a pretense.  2: The events described in the passage are mostly a conversation between the landlady and Susan. This conversation probably took a few minutes.  3: Let's say three minutes have elapsed.  4: 3 minutes.  5: High confidence.
297	tomjones.txt|794|u	 While our politic landlord, who had not, we see, undeservedly the reputation of great wisdom among his neighbours, was engaged in debating this matter with himself (for he paid little attention to the opinion of his wife), news arrived that the rebels had given the duke the slip, and had got a day's march towards London; and soon after arrived a famous Jacobite squire, who, with great joy in his countenance, shook the landlord by the hand, saying, 'All's our own, boy, ten thousand honest Frenchmen are landed in Suffolk. Old England for ever! ten thousand French, my brave lad! I am going to tap away directly.'  This news determined the opinion of the wise man, and he resolved to make his court to the young lady when she arose; for he had now (he said) discovered that she was no other than Madam Jenny Cameron herself.   Chapter iii.  A very short chapter, in which however is a sun, a moon, a star, and an angel.   The sun (for he keeps very good hours at this time of the year) had been some time retired to rest when Sophia arose greatly refreshed by her sleep; which, short as it was, nothing but her extreme fatigue could have occasioned; for, though she had told her maid, and perhaps herself too, that she was perfectly easy when she left Upton, yet it is certain her mind was a little affected with that malady which is attended with all the restless symptoms of a fever, and is perhaps the very distemper which physicians mean (if they mean anything) by the fever on the spirits. 	1440.0	120	[2, 0, 1, 3]	VALID	1: The passage describes a landlord debating with himself about whether to court a young lady, when news arrives that rebels have moved closer to London. A Jacobite squire arrives with news of French troops landing in Suffolk. The chapter ends with Sophia waking up after a short sleep. 2: The events described in the passage are not very time-specific. The landlord's debate and the arrival of the squire might have taken a few hours, but it's impossible to say for sure. Sophia's sleep is described as short, but again, it's unclear how long that might have been. Let's say two hours have elapsed. 3: Two hours have elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour, that's 120 minutes. 4: 120 minutes. 5: Low confidence.
298	tomjones.txt|886|u	 Virgil, I think, tells us, that when the mob are assembled in a riotous and tumultuous manner, and all sorts of missile weapons fly about, if a man of gravity and authority appears amongst them, the tumult is presently appeased, and the mob, which when collected into one body, may be well compared to an ass, erect their long ears at the grave man's discourse.  On the contrary, when a set of grave men and philosophers are disputing; when wisdom herself may in a manner be considered as present, and administering arguments to the disputants; should a tumult arise among the mob, or should one scold, who is herself equal in noise to a mighty mob, appear among the said philosophers; their disputes cease in a moment, wisdom no longer performs her ministerial office, and the attention of every one is immediately attracted by the scold alone.  Thus the uproar aforesaid, and the arrival of the landlady, silenced the master of the puppet-show, and put a speedy and final end to that grave and solemn harangue, of which we have given the reader a sufficient taste already. Nothing indeed could have happened so very inopportune as this accident; the most wanton malice of fortune could not have contrived such another stratagem to confound the poor fellow, while he was so triumphantly descanting on the good morals inculcated by his exhibitions. His mouth was now as effectually stopt, as that of quack must be, if, in the midst of a declamation on the great virtues of his pills and powders, the corpse of one of his martyrs should be brought forth, and deposited before the stage, as a testimony of his skill. 	1.0	1	[2, 3, 1, 0]	VALID	1: The passage discusses how a mob can be silenced by a person of authority, and how a group of philosophers can be silenced by a scold. The arrival of a landlady interrupts a puppet-show master's speech on good morals.  2: The interruption of the puppet-show master's speech would have taken only a few seconds or minutes. The rest of the passage is a reflection on the nature of authority and interruption, and so no additional time needs to be added.  3: 1 minute has elapsed. 4: 1 minute. 5: High confidence.
299	tomjones.txt|983|u	 Though a gentle sigh, which stole from the bosom of Nancy, seemed to argue some secret disapprobation of these sentiments, she did not dare openly to oppose them. For as this good woman had all the tenderness, so she had preserved all the authority of a parent; and as her indulgence to the desires of her children was restrained only by her fears for their safety and future welfare, so she never suffered those commands which proceeded from such fears to be either disobeyed or disputed. And this the young gentleman, who had lodged two years in the house, knew so well, that he presently acquiesced in the refusal.  Mr Nightingale, who grew every minute fonder of Jones, was very desirous of his company that day to dinner at the tavern, where he offered to introduce him to some of his acquaintance; but Jones begged to be excused, 'as his cloaths,' he said, 'were not yet come to town.'  To confess the truth, Mr Jones was now in a situation, which sometimes happens to be the case of young gentlemen of much better figure than himself. In short, he had not one penny in his pocket; a situation in much greater credit among the antient philosophers than among the modern wise men who live in Lombard-street, or those who frequent White's chocolate-house. And, perhaps, the great honours which those philosophers have ascribed to an empty pocket may be one of the reasons of that high contempt in which they are held in the aforesaid street and chocolate-house. 	2.0	5	[0, 2, 1, 3]	VALID	1: Mr. Jones is staying with a woman named Nancy and her children. He declines an invitation to dinner because he doesn't have any money.  2: There is no explicit reference to time, but it takes some time for Nancy to establish her authority and for Jones to decline the invitation. Let's say five minutes.  3: 5 minutes have elapsed.  4: 5 minutes.  5: High confidence.

Then fetching a deep sigh, and laying hold of her hand, he ran on for some minutes in a strain which would be little more pleasing to the reader than it was to the lady; and at last concluded with a declaration, 'That if he was master of the world, he would lay it at her feet.' Sophia then, forcibly pulling away her hand from his, answered with much spirit, 'I promise you, sir, your world and its master I should spurn from me with equal contempt.' She then offered to go; and Lord Fellamar, again laying hold of her hand, said, 'Pardon me, my beloved angel, freedoms which nothing but despair could have tempted me to take.----Believe me, could I have had any hope that my title and fortune, neither of them inconsiderable, unless when compared with your worth, would have been accepted, I had, in the humblest manner, presented them to your acceptance.----But I cannot lose you.--By heaven, I will sooner part with my soul!--You are, you must, you shall be only mine.' 'My lord,' says she, 'I intreat you to desist from a vain pursuit; for, upon my honour, I will never hear you on this subject. Let go my hand, my lord; for I am resolved to go from you this moment; nor will I ever see you more.' 'Then, madam,' cries his lordship, 'I must make the best use of this moment; for I cannot live, nor will I live without you.'----'What do you mean, my lord?' 	5.0	5	[1, 0, 2, 3]	VALID	1: Lord Fellamar declares his love for Sophia, who rejects him. He refuses to let her go and insists that she must be his.  2: The passage describes a conversation, which would take at least a few minutes.

When Betty was departed, Mrs Miller said, 'I was desired, madam, by a very unhappy young gentleman, to deliver you this letter.' Sophia changed colour when she saw the direction, well knowing the hand, and after some hesitation, said--'I could not conceive, madam, from your appearance, that your business had been of such a nature.--Whomever you brought this letter from, I shall not open it. I should be sorry to entertain an unjust suspicion of any one; but you are an utter stranger to me.'  'If you will have patience, madam,' answered Mrs Miller, 'I will acquaint you who I am, and how I came by that letter.' 'I have no curiosity, madam, to know anything,' cries Sophia; 'but I must insist on your delivering that letter back to the person who gave it you.'  Mrs Miller then fell upon her knees, and in the most passionate terms implored her compassion; to which Sophia answered: 'Sure, madam, it is surprizing you should be so very strongly interested in the behalf of this person. I would not think, madam'--'No, madam,' says Mrs Miller, 'you shall not think anything but the truth. I will tell you all, and you will not wonder that I am interested. He is the best-natured creature that ever was born.'--She then began and related the story of Mr Anderson.--After this she cried, 'This, madam, this is his goodness; but I have much more tender obligations to him. He hath preserved my child.'--Here, after shedding some tears, she related everything concerning that fact, suppressing only those circumstances which would have most reflected on her daughter, and concluded with saying, 'Now, madam, you shall judge whether I can ever do enough for so kind, so good, so generous a young man; and sure he is the best and worthiest of all human beings.' 	5.0	5	[3, 1, 0, 2]	VALID	1: Mrs. Miller delivers a letter to Sophia, who recognizes the handwriting and refuses to read it. Mrs. Miller falls to her knees and implores Sophia to hear her story, which she does.  2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the events described would take at least a few minutes.  3: Let's say five minutes have elapsed.  4: 5 minutes.  5: High confidence.

'I can't say, sir,' answered he, 'that I am regularly a servant, but I live with him, an't please your honour, at present. _Non sum qualis eram_, as your honour very well knows.'  Mr Allworthy then asked him many questions concerning Jones, as to his health, and other matters; to all which Partridge answered, without having the least regard to what was, but considered only what he would have things appear; for a strict adherence to truth was not among the articles of this honest fellow's morality or his religion.  During this dialogue Mr Nightingale took his leave, and presently after Mrs Miller left the room, when Allworthy likewise despatched Blifil; for he imagined that Partridge when alone with him would be more explicit than before company. They were no sooner left in private together than Allworthy began, as in the following chapter.    Chapter vi.  In which the history is farther continued   'Sure, friend,' said the good man, 'you are the strangest of all human beings. Not only to have suffered as you have formerly for obstinately persisting in a falshood, but to persist in it thus to the last, and to pass thus upon the world for a servant of your own son! What interest can you have in all this? What can be your motive?' 	20.0	5.0	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: Allworthy questions Partridge about Tom Jones, and Partridge lies to him. Nightingale and Mrs. Miller leave the room, and Allworthy dismisses Blifil so he can speak to Partridge alone. Allworthy asks Partridge why he is lying about being Jones's servant. 2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the events described would have taken at least a few minutes. Allworthy asks many questions, and Nightingale, Mrs. Miller, and Blifil all leave the room. Let's say five minutes. 3: Five minutes have elapsed. At 60 seconds a minute, that's 300 seconds. 4: 300 seconds. 5: High confidence.
303	tomjones.txt|1415|u	As for Partridge, Jones hath settled £50 a-year on him; and he hath again set up a school, in which he meets with much better encouragement than formerly, and there is now a treaty of marriage on foot between him and Miss Molly Seagrim, which, through the mediationof Sophia, is likely to take effect. We now return to take leave of Mr Jones and Sophia, who, within two days after their marriage, attended Mr Western and Mr Allworthy into the country. Western hath resigned his family seat, and the greater part of his estate, to his son-in-law, and hath retired to a lesser house of his in another part of the country, which is better for hunting. Indeed, he is often as a visitant with Mr Jones, who, as well as his daughter, hath an infinite delight in doing everything in their power to please him. And this desire of theirs is attended with such success, that the old gentleman declares he was never happy in his life till now. He hath here a parlour and ante-chamber to himself, where he gets drunk with whom he pleases: and his daughter is still as ready as formerly to play to him whenever he desires it; for Jones hath assured her that, as, next to pleasing her, one of his highest satisfactions is to contribute to the happiness of the old man; so, the great duty which she expresses and performs to her father, renders her almost equally dear to him with the love which she bestows on himself.	3153600.0	43200	[0, 1, 3, 2]	VALID	1: This passage describes the aftermath of a marriage between two characters, Jones and Sophia. Jones has settled an income on Partridge, and there is a potential marriage between Partridge and another character, Molly Seagrim. Sophia and Jones have accompanied Mr. Western and Mr. Allworthy into the country, where Western has retired to a smaller house. Jones and Sophia are eager to please Western, and he is happy with his new situation. 2: There are no explicit references to time in this passage, but the events described suggest that some time has passed since the marriage. Let's say a month has passed. 3: One month is 30 days. 24 hours in a day, so 720 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 43200 minutes. 4: 43200 minutes. 5: Low confidence, as the passage does not give any explicit indication of time.
304	tomjones.txt|1416|u	 Sophia hath already produced him two fine children, a boy and a girl, of whom the old gentleman is so fond, that he spends much of his time in the nursery, where he declares the tattling of his little grand-daughter, who is above a year and a half old, is sweeter music than the finest cry of dogs in England.  Allworthy was likewise greatly liberal to Jones on the marriage, and hath omitted no instance of shewing his affection to him and his lady, who love him as a father. Whatever in the nature of Jones had a tendency to vice, has been corrected by continual conversation with this good man, and by his union with the lovely and virtuous Sophia. He hath also, by reflection on his past follies, acquired a discretion and prudence very uncommon in one of his lively parts.  To conclude, as there are not to be found a worthier man and woman, than this fond couple, so neither can any be imagined more happy. They preserve the purest and tenderest affection for each other, an affection daily encreased and confirmed by mutual endearments and mutual esteem. Nor is their conduct towards their relations and friends less amiable than towards one another. And such is their condescension, their indulgence, and their beneficence to those below them, that there is not a neighbour, a tenant, or a servant, who doth not most gratefully bless the day when Mr Jones was married to his Sophia. 	3153600.0	1576800	[1, 0, 3, 2]	VALID	1: This passage describes the happy marriage of Jones and Sophia, and the birth of their two children. It also describes the affection of Allworthy, Sophia's grandfather, for the children. 2: There are no explicit references to time in the passage. However, the birth of two children suggests that at least two years have passed since the marriage. Let's say three years have passed. 3: Three years have elapsed. At 365 days a year that's 1095 days. 24 hours in a day, so 26280 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 1576800 minutes. 4: 1576800 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the estimate is based on speculation about the passage of time.
305	sensesensibility.txt|0|u	 SENSE AND SENSIBILITY  by Jane Austen  (1811)     CHAPTER 1   The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex. Their estate was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance. The late owner of this estate was a single man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister. But her death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it. In the society of his nephew and niece, and their children, the old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent. His attachment to them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence. 	105120000.0	43200	[3, 1, 0, 2]	VALID	1: This passage describes the history of the Dashwood family, who have lived in Sussex for many generations. The late owner of the estate invited his nephew and his family to live with him after the death of his sister, and they provided him with comfort and companionship.  2: The passage describes a long history of the Dashwood family, but the events described in the passage itself are limited to the death of the owner's sister ten years before his own death and the subsequent arrival of his nephew and his family. These events could have taken place over a period of weeks or months, but it's impossible to say for sure. Let's say a month.  3: One month has elapsed. At 30 days a month that's 720 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 43200 minutes. 4: 43200 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the passage doesn't provide a clear timeline.
306	sensesensibility.txt|1|u	 By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present lady, three daughters. The son, a steady respectable young man, was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large, and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age. By his own marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his wealth. To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not so really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent of what might arise to them from their father's inheriting that property, could be but small. Their mother had nothing, and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to her child, and he had only a life-interest in it.  The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every other will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure. He was neither so unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew;--but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest. Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son;--but to his son, and his son's son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods.	7884000.0	15768000	[0, 1, 2, 3]	VALID	1: The passage describes the will of Mr. Henry Dashwood, who has died, and the inheritance of his estate.  2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but it does describe the death of Mr. Dashwood and the fact that his son has a four-year-old child. It's possible that the son is in his late twenties or early thirties, so let's say 30 years have elapsed since his birth.  3: 30 years have elapsed. At 365 days a year that's 10950 days x 24 hours in a day, so 262800 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 15768000 minutes. 4: 15768000 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the estimate is based on speculation about the age of Mr. Dashwood's son.
307	sensesensibility.txt|24|u	 Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth she had been betrayed into, in speaking of him. She felt that Edward stood very high in her opinion. She believed the regard to be mutual; but she required greater certainty of it to make Marianne's conviction of their attachment agreeable to her. She knew that what Marianne and her mother conjectured one moment, they believed the next--that with them, to wish was to hope, and to hope was to expect. She tried to explain the real state of the case to her sister.  'I do not attempt to deny,' said she, 'that I think very highly of him--that I greatly esteem, that I like him.'  Marianne here burst forth with indignation--  'Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh! worse than cold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise. Use those words again, and I will leave the room this moment.'  Elinor could not help laughing. 'Excuse me,' said she; 'and be assured that I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my own feelings. Believe them to be stronger than I have declared; believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the suspicion--the hope of his affection for me may warrant, without imprudence or folly. 	1.0	0	[2, 0, 1, 3]	CALC ERROR	1: Elinor and Marianne are discussing Elinor's feelings for Edward.

308	sensesensibility.txt|134|u	 Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton, and totally unlike her in every respect. She was short and plump, had a very pretty face, and the finest expression of good humour in it that could possibly be. Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister's, but they were much more prepossessing. She came in with a smile, smiled all the time of her visit, except when she laughed, and smiled when she went away. Her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife, but of less willingness to please or be pleased. He entered the room with a look of self-consequence, slightly bowed to the ladies, without speaking a word, and, after briefly surveying them and their apartments, took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read it as long as he staid.  Mrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed by nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy, was hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth.  'Well! what a delightful room this is! I never saw anything so charming! Only think, Mama, how it is improved since I was here last! I always thought it such a sweet place, ma'am!

He seems an excellent man; and I think him uncommonly pleasing.'  'So do I.--He is such a charming man, that it is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull. Mama says HE was in love with your sister too.-- I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he hardly ever falls in love with any body.'  'Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire?' said Elinor.  'Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe many people are acquainted with him, because Combe Magna is so far off; but they all think him extremely agreeable I assure you. Nobody is more liked than Mr. Willoughby wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister. She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour; not but that he is much more lucky in getting her, because she is so very handsome and agreeable, that nothing can be good enough for her.

And I hope you may have as good luck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already.'  Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward, than he had been with respect to Marianne; indeed it was rather his favourite joke of the two, as being somewhat newer and more conjectural; and since Edward's visit, they had never dined together without his drinking to her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and winks, as to excite general attention. The letter F--had been likewise invariably brought forward, and found productive of such countless jokes, that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long established with Elinor.  The Miss Steeles, as she expected, had now all the benefit of these jokes, and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the name of the gentleman alluded to, which, though often impertinently expressed, was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness into the concerns of their family. But Sir John did not sport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise, for he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name, as Miss Steele had in hearing it. 	60.0	0	[0, 2, 3, 1]	CALC ERROR	1: The passage describes a conversation in which a woman expresses hope that another woman will soon be married, and suggests that the woman may already have a romantic interest.

311	sensesensibility.txt|176|u	 From their counsel, or their conversation, she knew she could receive no assistance, their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress, while her self-command would neither receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise. She was stronger alone, and her own good sense so well supported her, that her firmness was as unshaken, her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable, as with regrets so poignant and so fresh, it was possible for them to be.  Much as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the subject, she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it; and this for more reasons than one. She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand what Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him, and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy, by her readiness to enter on the matter again, and her calmness in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend, which she very much feared her involuntary agitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at least doubtful. That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very probable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise, not merely from Lucy's assertion, but from her venturing to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance, with a secret so confessedly and evidently important. And even Sir John's joking intelligence must have had some weight. But indeed, while Elinor remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by Edward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she was so, her very confidence was a proof. What other reason for the disclosure of the affair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of Lucy's superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him in future? 	1440.0	180	[2, 1, 3, 0]	VALID	1: Elinor is dealing with her own emotions and trying to figure out Lucy's feelings for Edward. She wants to talk to Lucy again to clarify things and to show that she is not interested in Edward romantically.  2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage. The events described are mostly internal to Elinor's thoughts and feelings, so it's difficult to estimate how much time has passed. Let's guess that Elinor has been thinking about these things for a few hours.  3: Let's say 3 hours have elapsed.

On being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood, persuaded that such an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her daughters, and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to herself, how much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear of their declining the offer upon HER account; insisted on their both accepting it directly; and then began to foresee, with her usual cheerfulness, a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all, from this separation.  'I am delighted with the plan,' she cried, 'it is exactly what I could wish. Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves. When you and the Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music! You will find Margaret so improved when you come back again! I have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too, which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one. It is very right that you SHOULD go to town; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London. You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman, of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt. And in all probability you will see your brother, and whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife, when I consider whose son he is, I cannot bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other.' 	2	4320	[1, 2, 3, 0]	VALID	1: Mrs. Dashwood insists that her daughters accept an invitation despite the fact that Elinor is disgusted by the manners of the person who extended the invitation.

This delay on the Colonel's side, however, did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least, for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards, and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings very plainly heard Elinor say, and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said,  'I shall always think myself very much obliged to you.'  Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude, and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence, the Colonel should be able to take leave of them, as he immediately did, with the utmost sang-froid, and go away without making her any reply!--She had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a suitor.  What had really passed between them was to this effect.  'I have heard,' said he, with great compassion, 'of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family; for if I understand the matter right, he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman.-- Have I been rightly informed?--Is it so?--'  Elinor told him that it was.  'The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,'--he replied, with great feeling,--'of dividing, or attempting to divide, two young people long attached to each other, is terrible.-- Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doing--what she may drive her son to.

She thanked him for it with all her heart, spoke of Edward's principles and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve; and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure, if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office to another. But at the same time, she could not help thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself. It was an office in short, from which, unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an obligation from HER, she would have been very glad to be spared herself;-- but Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy, declining it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being given through her means, that she would not on any account make farther opposition. 	5.0	0	[3, 1, 0, 2]	CALC ERROR	1: A woman is offered a preferment to give to a man to enable him to marry.

The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried to raise her spirits, and make her believe, as she THEN really believed herself, that it would be a very short one.  The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient; she certainly was not better, and, except that there was no amendment, did not appear worse. Their party was now farther reduced; for Mr. Palmer, though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife, was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her; and while he was preparing to go, Colonel Brandon himself, with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going likewise.--Here, however, the kindness of Mrs.	1440.0	480	[1, 2, 3, 0]	VALID	1: Marianne is ill and unable to travel home as planned.

On the first day, Marianne is upset about the delay in their travel plans. On the second day, Marianne's condition has not improved, and Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon prepare to leave. Each day is described in a few sentences, so we can estimate that each day takes a few hours. Let's say four hours per day. 3: Eight hours have elapsed.

To know that Marianne was in town was--in the same language--a thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and daggers!--what a reproof would she have given me!--her taste, her opinions--I believe they are better known to me than my own,--and I am sure they are dearer.'  Elinor's heart, which had undergone many changes in the course of this extraordinary conversation, was now softened again;--yet she felt it her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last.

Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street, of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother's affairs might have done, if applied to in time. She repeated it to Edward.  'THAT was exactly like Robert,'--was his immediate observation.--'And THAT,' he presently added, 'might perhaps be in HIS head when the acquaintance between them first began. And Lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour. Other designs might afterward arise.'  How long it had been carrying on between them, however, he was equally at a loss with herself to make out; for at Oxford, where he had remained for choice ever since his quitting London, he had had no means of hearing of her but from herself, and her letters to the very last were neither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual. Not the smallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred to prepare him for what followed;--and when at last it burst on him in a letter from Lucy herself, he had been for some time, he believed, half stupified between the wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance. He put the letter into Elinor's hands. 	120.0	259200	[0, 1, 2, 3]	VALID	1: Edward and Elinor are discussing how Edward's former love interest, Lucy, came to be engaged to Edward's brother.

Who that cares much to know the history of man, and how the mysterious mixture behaves under the varying experiments of Time, has not dwelled, at least briefly, on the life of Saint Theresa, has not smiled with some gentleness at the thought of the little girl walking forth one morning hand in hand with her still smaller brother, to go and seek martyrdom in the country of the Moors ? Out they toddled from rugged Avila, wide eyed and helpless looking as two fawns, but with human hearts, already beating to a national idea ; until domestic reality met them in the shape of uncles, and turned them back from their great resolve. That child pilgrimage was a fit beginning. Theresa's passionate, ideal nature demanded an epic life : what were many volumed romances of chivalry and the social conquests of a brilliant girl to her? Her flame quickly burned up that light fuel ; and, fed from within, soared after some illimitable satisfaction, some object which would never justify weariness, which would reconcile self despair with the rapturous consciousness of life beyond self. She found her epos in the reform of a religious order.  That Spanish woman who lived three hundred years ago, was certainly not the last of her kind.

With dim lights and tangled circumstance they tried to shape their thought and deed in noble agreement ; but after all, to common eyes their struggles seemed mere inconsistency and formlessness ; for these later born Theresas were helped by no coherent social faith and order which could perform the function of knowledge for the ardently willing soul. Their ardour alternated between a vague ideal and the common yearning of womanhood ; so that the one was disapproved as extravagance, and the other condemned as a lapse.  Some have felt that these blundering lives are due to the inconvenient indefiniteness with which the Supreme Power has fashioned the natures of women : if there were one level of feminine incompetence as strict as the ability to count three and no more, the social lot of women might be treated with scientific certitude. Meanwhile the indefiniteness remains, and the limits of variation are really much wider than any one would imagine from the sameness of women's coiffure and the favourite love stories in prose and verse. Here and there a cygnet is reared uneasily among the ducklings in the brown pond, and never finds the living stream in fellowship with its own oary footed kind.

On the oiler of the food ordered by Lydgate, which he refused, and the denial of other things which he demanded, he seemed to concentrate all his terror on Bulstrode, imploringly deprecating his anger, his revenge on him by starvation, aud declaring with strong oaths that he had never told any mortal a word against him. Even this Bulstrode felt that he would not have liked Lydgate to hear ; but a more alarming sign of fitful alternation in his delirium was, that in the morning twilight Eaffles suddenly seemed to imagine a doctor present, addressing him and declaring that Bulstrode wanted to starve him to death out of revenge for telling, when he never had told.  Bulstrode's native imperiousness and strength of determination served hiru well.

It was mainly what we know, including the fact about Will Ladislaw, with some local colour and circumstance added : it was what Bulstrode had dreaded the betrayal of, — and hoped to have buried forever with the corpse of Raffles, — it   26o MIDDLEMAIICH.  was that haunting ghost of his earlier life which as he rode past the archway of the Green Dragon he was trusting that Providence had delivered him from. Yes, Providence. He had not confessed to himself yet that he liad done anythmg in the way of contrivance to tiiis end ; he had accepted what seemed to have been offered. It was impossible to prove that he had done anything which hastened the departure of that man's soul.  But this gossip about Bulstrode spread through Middlemarch like the smell of fire. Mr. Frank Hawley followed up his information by sending a clerk whom he could trust to Stone Court on a pretext of intiuiring about hay, but really to gather all that cculd be learned about Raffles and his illness from Mrs. Abel. In this v^'ay it came to his knowledge that Mr. Garth had carried the man to Stone Court in his gig ; and Mr. Hawley in consequence took an opportunity of seeing Caleb, calling at his office to ask whether he had time to undertake an arbitration if it were re({uired, and then asking him incidentally al)Out Raffles. Caleb was betrayed mto no word injurious to Bulstrode beyond the fact which he was forced to admit, that he had given up acting for him within the last week. Mr. Hawley drew his inferences, and feeling convinced that Rallies had told his story to Garth, and that Garth had given up Bulstrode's ali'airs in consequence, said so a few hours later to Mr. Toller. 	15120.0	10080	[3, 1, 0, 2]	VALID	1: The passage describes the spread of gossip about Bulstrode's past, and how people are trying to learn more about it.  2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the passage describes the spread of gossip and the actions of several characters, which would take some time. Let's say a week has passed since the previous events in the novel.  3: One week has elapsed.

There was nothing unendurable now : the debts were paid, Mr. Ladislaw was coming, and Lydgate would be persuaded to leave Middlemarch and settle in L<jndon, which was ' so different from a provincial town.'  That was a bright bit of morning. But soon the sky became black over poor Eosamond. The presence of a new gluom in her husband, about which he was entirely reserved towards her, — for he dreaded to expose his lacerated feeling to her neutrality and misconception, — soon received a painfully strange explanation, alien to all her previous notions of what could affect her happiness. In the new gaiety of her spirits, thinking that Lydgate had merely a worse fit of moodiness than usual, causing him to leave her remarks unanswered, and evidently to keep out of her way as much as possible, she chose, a few days after the meeting, and without speaking to him on the subject, to send out notes of invitation for a small evening party, feeling convinced that this was a judicious step, since people seemed to have been keeping aloof from them, and wanted restoring to the old habit of intercourse. 	4320.0	10080	[2, 3, 0, 1]	VALID	1: Lydgate reads a letter to Eosamond, which makes her happy. She thinks Lydgate will leave Middlemarch and settle in London. However, Lydgate's mood changes and he becomes reserved towards her. Eosamond sends out invitations for a party to restore their social life. 2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the passage describes a range of events that could have taken place over a few days to a few weeks. Let's say a week has passed since Lydgate received the letter and Eosamond sent out the invitations. 3: One week has elapsed.

Where women love each other, men learn to smother their mutual dislike. Sir James never liked Ladislaw, and Will always preferred to have Sir James's company mixed with another kind: they were on a   424 MIDDLEMARCH.  footing of reciprocal tolerance which was made quite easy only when Dorothea and Celia were present.  It became an understood thing that Mr. and Mrs. Ladislaw should pay at least two visits during the year to the Grange, and there came gradually a small row of cousins at Freshitt who enjoyed playing with the two cousins visiting Tipton as much as if the blood of these cousins had been less dubiously mixed.  Mr. Brook lived to a good old age, and his estate was inherited by Dorothea's son, who might have represented Middlemarch, but declined, thinking that his opinions had less chance of being stifled if he remained out of doors.  Sir James never ceased to regard Dorothea's second marriage as' a mistake ; and indeed this remained the tradition concerning it in Middle march, where she was spoken of to a younger generation as a fine girl who married a sickly clergyman, old enough to be her father, and in little more than a year after his death gave up her estate to marry his cousin, — young enough to have been his son, with no property, and not wellborn. 	13140000.0	5256000	[3, 1, 0, 2]	VALID	1: The passage describes a reconciliation between Sir James and Dorothea and her husband, Will Ladislaw. It also mentions the birth of Dorothea's son and his decision not to represent Middlemarch. Finally, it describes how Dorothea's second marriage was viewed in Middlemarch. 2: There are several events mentioned in the passage, but no explicit reference to time. However, we know that Dorothea's son inherited Mr. Brooke's estate, which suggests that at least 20 years have passed since the beginning of the novel. We can also infer that Dorothea's second marriage has become part of the local tradition, which suggests that it has been several years since it occurred. Let's say 10 years have passed since Dorothea's second marriage. 3: 10 years have elapsed. At 365 days a year that's 3650 days x 24 hours in a day, so 87600 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 5256000 minutes. 4: 5256000 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the estimate is based on inference and speculation.

Certainly those determinmg acts of her life were not ideally beautiful. They were the mixed result of young and noble impulse struggling amidst the conditions of an imperfect social state, in which great feelings will often take the aspect of error, and great faith the aspect of illusion. For there is no creature whose inward being is so strong that it   SUNSET AND SUNRISE. 425  is not greatly determined by what lies outside it. A new Theresa will hardly have the opportunity of reforming a conventual life, any more than a new Antigone will spend her heroic piety in daring all for the sake of a brother's burial : the medium in which their ardent deeds took shape is forever gone. But we insignificant people with our daily words and acts are preparing the lives of many Dorotheas, some of which may present a far sadder sacrifice than that of the Dorothea whose story we know.  Her finely touched spirit had still its fine issues, though they were not widely visible. Her full nature, like that river of which Cyrus broke the strength, spent itself in channels which had no great name on the earth. But the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive : for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts ; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.  •THE END. 	26280000.0	26280000	[1, 2, 0, 3]	VALID	1: This passage is a reflection on the life of a woman named Dorothea, who made choices that were not 'ideally beautiful' but were the result of 'young and noble impulse struggling amidst the conditions of an imperfect social state.' The passage concludes with a reflection on the importance of 'unhistoric acts' and the 'number who lived faithfully a hidden life.' 2: The passage does not include any explicit reference to time, but it does reflect on the life of a woman who has already lived and died. The reflection is philosophical and abstract, so it is difficult to estimate how much time is described. Let's say that the passage reflects on the entirety of Dorothea's life, which might have spanned several decades. 3: Let's say that Dorothea's life spanned 50 years. At 365 days a year that's 18250 days x 24 hours in a day, so 438000 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 26280000 minutes. 4: 26280000 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the passage is abstract and philosophical and does not include any explicit reference to time.
337	BiggES.txt|0|u	CHAPTER I  'WEEP NO MORE, MY LADY'   A young woman was crying bitterly in the waiting-room of the railway station at Upper Asquewan Falls, New York.  A beautiful young woman? That is exactly what Billy Magee wanted to know as, closing the waiting-room door behind him, he stood staring just inside. Were the features against which that frail bit of cambric was agonizingly pressed of a pleasing contour? The girl's neatly tailored corduroy suit and her flippant but charming millinery augured well. Should he step gallantly forward and inquire in sympathetic tones as to the cause of her woe? Should he carry chivalry even to the lengths of Upper Asquewan Falls?  No, Mr. Magee decided he would not. The train that had just roared away into the dusk had not brought him from the region of skyscrapers and derby hats for deeds of knight errantry up state. Anyhow, the girl's tears were none of his business. A railway station was a natural place for grief--a field of many partings, upon whose floor fell often in torrents the tears of those left behind. A friend, mayhap a lover, had been whisked off into the night by the relentless five thirty-four local. Why not a lover? Surely about such a dainty trim figure as this courtiers hovered as moths about a flame. Upon a tender intimate sorrow it was not the place of an unknown Magee to intrude. He put his hand gently upon the latch of the door. 	0.33320000000000005	5	[1, 0, 2, 3]	VALID	1: A young woman is crying in a train station waiting room.

Oh, beyond question, she was most alluring. Mr. Magee stepped softly to the ticket window and made low-voiced inquiry of the man inside.  'What's she crying about?' he asked.  A thin sallow face, on the forehead of which a mop of ginger-colored hair lay listlessly, was pressed against the bars.  'Thanks,' said the ticket agent. 'I get asked the same old questions so often, one like yours sort of breaks the monotony. Sorry I can't help you. She's a woman, and the Lord only knows why women cry. And sometimes I reckon even He must be a little puzzled. Now, my wife--'  'I think I'll ask her,' confided Mr. Magee in a hoarse whisper.  'Oh, I wouldn't,' advised the man behind the bars. 'It's best to let 'em alone. They stop quicker if they ain't noticed.'  'But she's in trouble,' argued Billy Magee.  'And so'll you be, most likely,' responded the cynic, 'if you interfere. No, siree! Take my advice. Shoot old Asquewan's rapids in a barrel if you want to, but keep away from crying women.'  The heedless Billy Magee, however, was already moving across the unscrubbed floor with chivalrous intention. 	1.8	2	[3, 1, 0, 2]	VALID	1: A man named Mr. Magee is in a waiting room and sees a woman crying.

339	BiggES.txt|4|u	 'Certainly,' replied Mr. Magee. He turned away. As he did so he collided with a rather excessive lady. She gave the impression of solidity and bulk; her mouth was hard and knowing. Mr. Magee felt that she wanted to vote, and that she would say as much from time to time. The lady had a glittering eye; she put it to its time-honored use and fixed Mr. Magee with it.  'I was crying, mamma,' the girl explained, 'and this gentleman inquired if he could be of any service.'  Mamma! Mr. Magee wanted to add his tears to those of the girl. This frail and lovely damsel in distress owning as her maternal parent a heavy unnecessary--person! The older woman also had yellow hair, but it was the sort that suggests the white enamel pallor of a drug store, with the soda-fountain fizzing and the bottles of perfume ranged in an odorous row. Mamma! Thus rolled the world along.  'Well, they ain't no use gettin' all worked up for nothing,' advised the unpleasant parent. Mr. Magee was surprised that in her tone there was no hostility to him--thus belying her looks. 'Mebbe the gentleman can direct us to a good hotel,' she added, with a rather stagy smile.  'I'm a stranger here, too,' Mr. Magee replied. 'I'll interview the man over there in the cage.'  The gentleman referred to was not cheerful in his replies. There was, he said, Baldpate Inn. 	1.5	0.5	[0, 2, 3, 1]	VALID	1: A man named Mr. Magee collides with a woman and her daughter. The daughter explains that she was crying and Mr. Magee offered to help.

He seemed surprised that they came to Magee's room without incident. Inside, Mr. Magee drew up an easy chair before the fire, and offered his guest a cigar.  'You must be cold,' he said. 'Sit here. 'A bad night, stranger' as they remark in stories.'  'You've said it,' replied the young man, accepting the cigar. 'Thanks.' He walked to the door leading into the hall and opened it about a foot. 'I'm afraid,' he explained jocosely, 'we'll get to talking, and miss the breakfast bell.' He dropped into the chair, and lighted his cigar at a candle end. 'Say, you never can tell, can you? Climbing up old Baldpate I thought to myself, that hotel certainly makes the Sahara Desert look like a cozy corner. And here you are, as snug and comfortable and at home as if you were in a Harlem flat. You never can tell. And what now? The story of my life?'  'You might relate,' Mr. Magee told him, 'that portion of it that has led you trespassing on a gentleman seeking seclusion at Baldpate Inn.'  The stranger looked at Mr. Magee. He had an eye that not only looked, but weighed, estimated, and classified. Mr. Magee met it smilingly.  'Trespassing, eh?' said the young man. 'Far be it from me to quarrel with a man who smokes as good cigars as you do--but there's something I haven't quite doped out. That is--who's trespassing, me or you?' 	3.0	5	[1, 3, 0, 2]	VALID	1: A young man enters Magee's room and they exchange pleasantries. The young man jokes about missing breakfast and then asks who is trespassing. 2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage.

My name's Peters--Jake Peters--in the winter. But in the summer, when the inn's open, and the red and white awnings are out, and the band plays in the casino every night--then I'm the Hermit of Baldpate Mountain. I come down here and sell picture post-cards of myself to the ladies.'  Mr. Magee appeared overcome with mirth.  'A professional hermit, by the gods!' he cried. 'Say, I didn't know Baldpate Mountain was fitted up with all the modern improvements. This is great luck. I'm an amateur at the hermit business, you'll have to teach me the fine points. Sit down.'  'Just between ourselves, I'm not a regular hermit,' said the plump bewhiskered one, sitting gingerly on the edge of a frail chair. 'Not one of these 'all for love of a woman' hermits you read about in books. Of course, I have to pretend I am, in summer, in order to sell the cards and do my whole duty by the inn management. A lot of the women ask me in soft tones about the great disappointment that drove me to old Baldpate, and I give 'em various answers, according to how I feel. Speaking to you as a friend, and considering the fact that it's the dead of winter, I may say there was little or no romance in my life. I married early, and stayed married a long time. I came up here for peace and quiet, and because I felt a man ought to read something besides time-tables and tradesmen's bills, and have something over his head besides a first and second mortgage.' 	2.2	5	[3, 0, 2, 1]	VALID	1: Two men are talking. One of them, Peters, claims to be a hermit who lives on Baldpate Mountain. The other, Mr. Magee, is amused by this and asks Peters to teach him the 'fine points' of being a hermit. Peters admits that he is not a real hermit, but pretends to be one in the summer to sell postcards and please the inn management. He came to the mountain for peace and quiet and to read more. 2: The passage does not include any explicit reference to time. However, Peters mentions that he only pretends to be a hermit in the summer, so we can guess that the conversation takes place in the winter. The conversation itself is brief and does not involve any actions that would take a significant amount of time.

Inside once more, Mr. Magee remarked thoughtfully:  'Who would have guessed a week ago that to-day I would be climbing the broad staircase of a summer hotel carrying a pail of water for a lady fair?'  They paused on the landing.  'There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,' smiled the girl, 'than are dreamed of, even by novelists.' Mr. Magee started. Had she recognized him as the Magee of light fiction? It seemed hardly likely; they read his books, but they rarely remembered his name. Her face went suddenly grave. She came closer. 'I can't help wondering,' she said, 'which side you are on?'  'Which side of what?' asked Magee.  'Why, of this,' she answered, waving her hand toward the office below.  'I don't understand,' objected Mr. Magee.  'Let's not be silly,' she replied. 'You know what brought me here. I know what brought you. There are three sides, and only one is honest. I hope, so very much, that you are on that side.'  'Upon my word--' began Magee.  'Will it interest you to know,' she continued, 'I saw the big mayor of Reuton in the village this morning? With him was his shadow, Lou Max. Let's see--you had the first key, Mr. Bland the second, the professor the third, and I had the fourth.

For a while Sam sits there with a grouch as he thought how hard it was to put business aside and get a little rest now and then, and debating whether, being on a vacation, as it was, he'd exert himself enough to stretch forth his hand and take whatever money the guy had. While he was arguing the matter with himself, the jay settled the question by coming over and sitting down near him.  'He's in the city, he tells Sam, to enjoy the moving pictures of the streets, and otherwise forget the trees back home that grow the cherries in the bottom of the cocktail glasses. 'And believe me,' he says to Sam, 'there ain't none of those confidence men going to get me. I'm too wise,' he says.

The man Mr. Bland heard walking about to-night. I saw him and I was terribly frightened. It's all right when you know who the other fellow is, but when--it's all so creepy--I was afraid. So I ran--here.'  'The thing to do,' approved Mr. Magee. 'Don't worry. I'll get the money for you. I'll get it if I have to slay the city administration of Reuton in its tracks.'  'You trust me?' asked the girl, with a little catch in her voice. The snow lay white on her hair; even in the shadows her eyes suggested June skies. 'Without knowing who I am, or why I must have this money--you'll get it for me?'  'Some people,' said Mr. Magee, 'meet all their lives long at pink little teas, and never know one another, while others just smile at each other across a station waiting-room--that's enough.'  'I'm so glad,' whispered the girl. 'I never dreamed I'd meet any one like you--up here. Please, oh, please, be very careful. Neither Cargan nor Max is armed. Bland is. I should never forgive myself if you were hurt. But you won't be--will you?' 	1.9	5	[0, 1, 2, 3]	VALID	1: A man and a woman are talking in the snow. The woman is afraid of someone and the man promises to get her money for her.  2: There are no explicit references to time.

'I've just been thinking,' he said lightly, 'what an absolutely ridiculous figure I must be in your eyes, buzzing round and round like a bee in a bottle, and getting nowhere at all. Listen--no one has left the inn. While they stay, there's hope. Am I not to have one more chance--a chance to prove to you how much I care?'  She turned, and even in the dusk he saw that her eyes were wet.  'Oh, I don't know, I don't know,' she whispered. 'I'm not angry any more. I'm just--at sea. I don't know what to think--what to do. Why try any longer? I think I'll go away--and give up.'  'You mustn't do that,' urged Magee. They came back into the firelight. 'Miss Thornhill has just informed me that she knows who has the package!'  'Indeed,' said the girl calmly, but her face had flushed.  'I didn't let her tell me, of course.'  'Why not?' Oh, how maddening women could be!  'Why not?' Magee's tone was hurt. 'Because I couldn't use her information in getting the money for you.'  'You are still 'going to' get the money for me?'  Maddening certainly, as a rough-edged collar. 	1.9	3	[2, 0, 1, 3]	VALID	1: A man and a woman have a conversation in the dark. The woman is upset and considering giving up, but the man urges her not to. They then discuss a package and the man's efforts to get money for the woman. 2: There are no explicit references to time.

I feel that God's good air was meant to be breathed, not barricaded from our bodies.'  'Perhaps,' suggested Magee, 'I should have left the window open?'  The old man regarded him narrowly.  'I have no wish to be inhospitable,' he replied. 'But--if you please--'  'Certainly,' answered Magee. He threw open the window. The professor held up his book.  'I was passing the time before dinner with my pleasant old companion, Montaigne. Mr. Magee, have you ever read his essay on liars?'  'Never,' said Magee. 'But I do not blame you for brushing up on it at the present time, Professor. I have come to apologize. Yesterday morning I referred in a rather unpleasant way to a murder in the chemical laboratory at one of our universities. I said that the professor of chemistry was missing. This morning's paper, which I secured from Mr. Peters, informs me that he has been apprehended.'  'You need not have troubled to tell me,' said the old man. He smiled his bleak smile.  'I did you an injustice,' went on Magee.  'Let us say no more of it,' pleaded Professor Bolton.  Mr. Magee walked about the room. Warily the professor turned so that the other was at no instant at his back. He looked so helpless, so little, so ineffectual, that Mr. Magee abandoned his first plan of leaping upon him there in the silence. By more subtle means than this must his purpose be attained. 	2.5	3	[3, 1, 0, 2]	VALID	1: A man named Magee apologizes to an old man for a remark he made about a murder in a chemical laboratory. The old man is reading Montaigne and is a 'fresh air devotee.' Magee opens a window.  2: There is no explicit reference to time.

347	BiggES.txt|210|u	 'Mr. Hayden,' remarked Magee, 'are we to hear from you?'  Hayden hesitated, and looked for a moment into the black eyes of Myra Thornhill.  'My idea has often been contradicted,' he said, keeping his gaze on the girl, 'it may be again. But to me the greatest romance in the world is the romance of money making--dollar piling on dollar in the vaults of the man who started with a shoe-string, and hope, and nerve. I see him fighting for the first thousand--and then I see his pile growing, slowly at first--faster--faster--faster--until a motor-car brings him to his office, and men speak his name with awe in the streets.'  'Money,' commented Miss Thornhill contemptuously. 'What an idea of romance for a man.'  'I did not expect,' replied Hayden, 'that my definition would pass unchallenged. My past experiences--' he looked meaningly at the girl--'had led me to be prepared for that. But it is my definition--I spoke the truth. You must give me credit for that.'  'I ain't one to blame you,' sneered Cargan, 'for wanting it noticed when you do side-step a lie. Yes, I certainly--'  'See here, Cargan,' blazed Hayden.  'Yes, you did speak the truth,' put in Miss Thornhill hastily. 'You mentioned one word in your definition--it was a desecration to drag it in--hope. For me romance means only--hope. And I'm afraid there are a pitiful number in the world to whom it means the same.' 	2.0	3	[1, 3, 2, 0]	VALID	1: A group of people are discussing the definition of romance. Hayden argues that the greatest romance is money-making, while Myra Thornhill disagrees and says that romance means hope.  2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage.

348	BiggES.txt|237|u	 'I found a half-inch of open space,' explained the old man. 'Yes, I actually lay on my stomach in the snow and watched you. In the morning, for the first time in my life, I committed robbery. My punishment was swift and sure. Bland swooped down upon me. Again this afternoon, I came upon the precious package, after a long search, in the hands of the Hermit of Baldpate. I thought we were safe at last when I handed the package to Kendrick in my room to-night--but I had not counted on the wild things a youth like you will do for love of a designing maid.'  Twelve o'clock! The civic center of Upper Asquewan Falls proclaimed it. Mr. Magee had never been in Reuton. He was sorry he hadn't. He had to construct from imagination alone the great Reuton station through which the girl and the money must now be hurrying--where? The question would not down. Was she--as the professor believed--designing?  'No,' said Mr. Magee, answering aloud his own question. 'You are wrong, sir. I do not know just what the motives of Miss Norton were in desiring this money, but I will stake my reputation as an honest hold-up man that they were perfectly all right.'  'Perhaps,' replied the other, quite unconvinced. 'But--what honest motive could she have? I am able to assign her no rôle in this little drama. I have tried. I am able to see no connection between her and the other characters. What--' 	2.0	10	[1, 0, 2, 3]	VALID	1: The passage begins with an old man explaining how he watched someone, then committed robbery. He later finds the package he stole in the hands of the Hermit of Baldpate, and then hands it to Kendrick. The passage then shifts to Mr. Magee, who is imagining the girl and the money he believes she has, and defending her motives to himself.  2: There are no explicit references to time in the passage. The events described are mostly mental, so it's difficult to estimate how much time they would take. Let's say the events described take about 10 minutes.  3: 10 minutes have elapsed. 4: 10 minutes. 5: Low confidence.
349	BiggES.txt|239|u	 'Yes,' answered Professor Bolton. 'In one of his letters long ago Hayden told Kendrick he was engaged to the girl. It was the last letter Kendrick received from him.'  There was a pause.  'The important point now,' the old man went on, 'is the identity of this girl to whom you have made your princely gift, out of the goodness of your young heart. I propose to speak to the woman she has introduced as her mother, and elicit what information I can.'  He crossed the floor, followed by Mr. Magee, and stood by the woman's chair. She looked up, her eyes heavy with sleep, her appearance more tawdry than ever in that faint light.  'Madam,' remarked the professor, with the air of a judge trying a case, 'your daughter has to-night made her escape from this place with a large sum of money earnestly desired by the prosecuting attorney of Reuton county. In the name of the law, I command you to tell me her destination, and what she proposes to do with that package of greenbacks.'  The woman blinked stupidly in the dusk.  'She ain't my daughter,' she replied, and Mr. Magee's heart leaped up. 'I can tell you that much. I keep a boarding-house in Reuton and Miss--the girl you speak about--has been my boarder for three years. She brought me up here as a sort of chaperon, though I don't see as I'm old enough for that yet. You don't get nothing else out of me--except that she is a perfectly lovely young woman, and your money couldn't be safer with the president of the United States.' 	2.1	5	[1, 3, 2, 0]	VALID	1: Professor Bolton and Mr. Magee are discussing a woman who has absconded with a large sum of money. Professor Bolton proposes to interrogate the woman's mother, who is present, to find out where the woman has gone. The mother denies that the woman is her daughter, but reveals that she has been boarding with her for three years. 2: The passage describes a conversation and a pause, but no explicit reference to time. The events described could have taken place in a matter of minutes.  3: Let's say 5 minutes have elapsed. 4: 5 minutes. 5: High confidence.

Ain't had much experience in these things, or he'd know he might just as well tremble at the approach of a blue-bottle fly. We put him on a train going the other direction from Reuton early this morning. He thinks he'd better seek his fortune elsewhere.' He leaned in heavy confidence toward Magee. 'Say, young fellow,' he whispered, 'put me wise. That little sleight of hand game you worked last night had me dizzy. Where's the coin? Where's the girl? What's the game? Take the boodle and welcome--it ain't mine--but put me next to what's doing, so I'll know how my instalment of this serial story ought to read.'  'Mr. Cargan,' replied Magee, 'you know as much about that girl as I do. She asked me to get her the money, and I did.'  'But what's your place in the game?'  'A looker-on in Athens,' returned Magee. 'Translated, a guy who had bumped into a cyclone and was sitting tight waiting for it to blow over. I--I took a fancy to her, as you might put it. She wanted the money. I got it for her.'  'A pretty fairy story, my boy,' the mayor commented.  'Absolutely true,' smiled Magee.

Mr. Max leered. 	2.0	2	[0, 1, 3, 2]	VALID	1: Two men discuss a third who has fled town, then one asks the other about a woman and some money.

351	BiggES.txt|295|u	 And, on an easel, the sad portrait of a gentleman, undoubtedly the late lamented Norton. His uninteresting nose appeared to turn up at the constant odor of cookery in which it dwelt; his hair was plastered down over his forehead in a gorgeous abandoned curve such as some of the least sophisticated of Mr. John T. McCutcheon's gentlemen affect.  Mr. Magee stared round the room and smiled. Was the romance of reality never to resemble the romance of his dreams? Where were the dim lights, where the distant waltz, where the magic of moonlight amid which he was some day to have told a beautiful girl of his love? Hardly in Mrs. Norton's parlor.  She came and stood in the doorway. Hatless, coatless, smiling, she flooded the place with her beauty. Mr. Magee looked at the flabby angels on the wall, expecting them to hide their faces in shame. But no, they still rode brazenly their unstable clouds.  'Come in,' he cried. 'Don't leave me alone here again, please. And tell me--is this the gentleman who took the contract for making Mrs. Norton happy?'  'I--I can't come in,' she said, blushing. She seemed to wish to avoid him. 'Yes, that is Mr. Norton.' She came nearer the easel, and smiled at the late lamented's tonsorial crown. 'I must leave you--just a moment--'  Billy Magee's heart beat wildly. His breath came fast. He seized her by the hand. 	1.0	5	[2, 3, 1, 0]	VALID	1: Mr. Magee is in a room with a portrait of a man named Norton.

Look at me--look at me, please.'  'It has happened so quickly,' she murmured. 'Things can't be true when they--happen so quickly.'  'A woman's logic,' said Mr. Magee. 'It has happened. My beautiful girl. Look at me.'  And then--she looked. Trembling, flushed, half frightened, half exultant, she lifted her eyes to his.  'My little girl!' he cried down at her.  A moment longer she held off, and then limply she surrendered. And Billy Magee held her close in his arms.  'Take care of me,' she whispered. 'I--I love you so.' Her arm went timidly about his shoulders. 'Do you want to know my name? It's Mary--'  Mary what? The answer was seemingly of no importance, for Mr. Magee's lips were on hers, crushing the word at its birth.  So they stood, amid Mrs. Norton's gloomy objects of art. And presently she asked:  'How about the book, dear?'  But Mr. Magee had forgot.  'What book?' he asked.  'The novel you went to Baldpate to write Don't you remember, dearest--no melodrama, no wild chase, no--love?'  'Why--' Mr. Magee paused for a moment in the joy of his discovery. Then he came back to the greater joy in his arms.  'Why, darling,' he explained gently, 'this is it.'

We want no lazy idle loafers here, lazy idle little schemers. At your work, I tell you. Father Dolan will be in to see you every day. Father Dolan will be in tomorrow.

Stephen is too frightened to speak, but Father Arnall explains that Stephen broke his glasses and was exempted from work. The prefect of studies is angry and demands to know where Stephen broke his glasses. 2: The passage describes a single scene in a classroom, with no explicit reference to time.

But the same foreknowledge which had sickened his heart and made his legs sag suddenly as he raced round the park, the same intuition which had made him glance with mistrust at his trainer's flabby stubble-covered face as it bent heavily over his long stained fingers, dissipated any vision of the future. In a vague way he understood that his father was in trouble and that this was the reason why he himself had not been sent back to Clongowes. For some time he had felt the slight change in his house; and those changes in what he had deemed unchangeable were so many slight shocks to his boyish conception of the world. The ambition which he felt astir at times in the darkness of his soul sought no outlet. A dusk like that of the outer world obscured his mind as he heard the mare's hoofs clattering along the tramtrack on the Rock Road and the great can swaying and rattling behind him. 	40320.0	5	[0, 2, 3, 1]	VALID	1: A boy thinks about his father's troubles and his own life, including the possibility of delivering milk. 2: The boy's thoughts are described in detail, but there is no explicit reference to time.

It surprised him to see that the play which he had known at rehearsals for a disjointed lifeless thing had suddenly assumed a life of its own. It seemed now to play itself, he and his fellow actors aiding it with their parts. When the curtain fell on the last scene he heard the void filled with applause and, through a rift in a side scene, saw the simple body before which he had acted magically deformed, the void of faces breaking at all points and falling asunder into busy groups.  He left the stage quickly and rid himself of his mummery and passed out through the chapel into the college garden. Now that the play was over his nerves cried for some further adventure. He hurried onwards as if to overtake it. The doors of the theatre were all open and the audience had emptied out. On the lines which he had fancied the moorings of an ark a few lanterns swung in the night breeze, flickering cheerlessly. He mounted the steps from the garden in haste, eager that some prey should not elude him, and forced his way through the crowd in the hall and past the two jesuits who stood watching the exodus and bowing and shaking hands with the visitors. He pushed onward nervously, feigning a still greater haste and faintly conscious of the smiles and stares and nudges which his powdered head left in its wake. 	150.0	7.5	[0, 1, 2, 3]	VALID	1: A man finishes a play and leaves the stage, feeling energized and seeking further adventure.

And through the several torments of the senses the immortal soul is tortured eternally in its very essence amid the leagues upon leagues of glowing fires kindled in the abyss by the offended majesty of the Omnipotent God and fanned into everlasting and ever-increasing fury by the breath of the anger of the God-head.  —Consider finally that the torment of this infernal prison is increased by the company of the damned themselves.

The damned howl and scream at one another, their torture and rage intensified by the presence of beings tortured and raging like themselves. All sense of humanity is forgotten.

To merge his life in the common tide of other lives was harder for him than any fasting or prayer and it was his constant failure to do this to his own satisfaction which caused in his soul at last a sensation of spiritual dryness together with a growth of doubts and scruples. His soul traversed a period of desolation in which the sacraments themselves seemed to have turned into dried-up sources. His confession became a channel for the escape of scrupulous and unrepented imperfections. His actual reception of the eucharist did not bring him the same dissolving moments of virginal self-surrender as did those spiritual communions made by him sometimes at the close of some visit to the Blessed Sacrament. The book which he used for these visits was an old neglected book written by saint Alphonsus Liguori, with fading characters and sere foxpapered leaves. A faded world of fervent love and virginal responses seemed to be evoked for his soul by the reading of its pages in which the imagery of the canticles was interwoven with the communicant's prayers. An inaudible voice seemed to caress the soul, telling her names and glories, bidding her arise as for espousal and come away, bidding her look forth, a spouse, from Amana and from the mountains of the leopards; and the soul seemed to answer with the same inaudible voice, surrendering herself: INTER UBERA MEA COMMORABITUR. 	80640.0	43200	[0, 1, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The passage describes a period of spiritual dryness in the life of a character, who finds it difficult to merge his life with others'.

At 30 days a month that's 720 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 43200 minutes. 4: 43200 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the passage is vague about the time frame.
361	JoycJA.txt|215|u	 To receive that call, Stephen, said the priest, is the greatest honour that the Almighty God can bestow upon a man. No king or emperor on this earth has the power of the priest of God. No angel or archangel in heaven, no saint, not even the Blessed Virgin herself, has the power of a priest of God: the power of the keys, the power to bind and to loose from sin, the power of exorcism, the power to cast out from the creatures of God the evil spirits that have power over them; the power, the authority, to make the great God of Heaven come down upon the altar and take the form of bread and wine. What an awful power, Stephen!  A flame began to flutter again on Stephen's cheek as he heard in this proud address an echo of his own proud musings. How often had he seen himself as a priest wielding calmly and humbly the awful power of which angels and saints stood in reverence! His soul had loved to muse in secret on this desire. He had seen himself, a young and silent-mannered priest, entering a confessional swiftly, ascending the altarsteps, incensing, genuflecting, accomplishing the vague acts of the priesthood which pleased him by reason of their semblance of reality and of their distance from it. In that dim life which he had lived through in his musings he had assumed the voices and gestures which he had noted with various priests.	1576800.0	0	[3, 0, 1, 2]	CALC ERROR	1: A priest tells Stephen that being called to the priesthood is the greatest honor that God can bestow upon a man. Stephen is reminded of his own desire to become a priest and his musings on the power and authority that comes with it. 2: The passage describes Stephen's thoughts and the priest's speech, but there is no explicit reference to time. We can guess that Stephen's musings and desire to become a priest have been ongoing for some time, but it's impossible to determine how long.  3: N/A 4: N/A 5: High confidence that no specific amount of time is described in the passage.

Tea was nearly over and only the last of the second watered tea remained in the bottoms of the small glass jars and jampots which did service for teacups. Discarded crusts and lumps of sugared bread, turned brown by the tea which had been poured over them, lay scattered on the table. Little wells of tea lay here and there on the board, and a knife with a broken ivory handle was stuck through the pith of a ravaged turnover.  The sad quiet grey-blue glow of the dying day came through the window and the open door, covering over and allaying quietly a sudden instinct of remorse in Stephen's heart. All that had been denied them had been freely given to him, the eldest; but the quiet glow of evening showed him in their faces no sign of rancour.  He sat near them at the table and asked where his father and mother were. One answered:  —Goneboro toboro lookboro atboro aboro houseboro.  Still another removal! A boy named Fallon in Belvedere had often asked him with a silly laugh why they moved so often. A frown of scorn darkened quickly his forehead as he heard again the silly laugh of the questioner.  He asked:  —Why are we on the move again if it's a fair question? 	1.2	40	[1, 3, 0, 2]	VALID	1: A boy named Stephen enters a kitchen where his siblings are finishing tea. He asks where his parents are and learns they have gone to look at a house. He recalls a boy who used to ask why they moved so often. 2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the scene describes the end of tea and the onset of evening.

So he had passed beyond the challenge of the sentries who had stood as guardians of his boyhood and had sought to keep him among them that he might be subject to them and serve their ends. Pride after satisfaction uplifted him like long slow waves. The end he had been born to serve yet did not see had led him to escape by an unseen path and now it beckoned to him once more and a new adventure was about to be opened to him. It seemed to him that he heard notes of fitful music leaping upwards a tone and downwards a diminished fourth, upwards a tone and downwards a major third, like triple-branching flames leaping fitfully, flame after flame, out of a midnight wood. It was an elfin prelude, endless and formless; and, as it grew wilder and faster, the flames leaping out of time, he seemed to hear from under the boughs and grasses wild creatures racing, their feet pattering like rain upon the leaves. Their feet passed in pattering tumult over his mind, the feet of hares and rabbits, the feet of harts and hinds and antelopes, until he heard them no more and remembered only a proud cadence from Newman:  —Whose feet are as the feet of harts and underneath the everlasting arms. 	5.0	0.5	[2, 3, 1, 0]	VALID	1: A character reflects on his escape from the university and his pride in doing so.

364	JoycJA.txt|229|u	 Disheartened, he raised his eyes towards the slow-drifting clouds, dappled and seaborne. They were voyaging across the deserts of the sky, a host of nomads on the march, voyaging high over Ireland, westward bound. The Europe they had come from lay out there beyond the Irish Sea, Europe of strange tongues and valleyed and woodbegirt and citadelled and of entrenched and marshalled races. He heard a confused music within him as of memories and names which he was almost conscious of but could not capture even for an instant; then the music seemed to recede, to recede, to recede, and from each receding trail of nebulous music there fell always one longdrawn calling note, piercing like a star the dusk of silence. Again! Again! Again! A voice from beyond the world was calling.  —Hello, Stephanos!  —Here comes The Dedalus!  —Ao!... Eh, give it over, Dwyer, I'm telling you, or I'll give you a stuff in the kisser for yourself... Ao!  —Good man, Towser! Duck him!  —Come along, Dedalus! Bous Stephanoumenos! Bous Stephaneforos!  —Duck him! Guzzle him now, Towser!  —Help! Help!... Ao!  He recognized their speech collectively before he distinguished their faces. The mere sight of that medley of wet nakedness chilled him to the bone. Their bodies, corpse-white or suffused with a pallid golden light or rawly tanned by the sun, gleamed with the wet of the sea. Their diving-stone, poised on its rude supports and rocking under their plunges, and the rough-hewn stones of the sloping breakwater over which they scrambled in their horseplay gleamed with cold wet lustre. The towels with which they smacked their bodies were heavy with cold seawater; and drenched with cold brine was their matted hair. 	3.0	3	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The protagonist looks up at the clouds and hears a voice calling his name. He then recognizes a group of people who are diving into the sea and playing on the breakwater.  2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the description of the clouds and the diving scene suggest a few minutes at most.  3: Let's say three minutes have elapsed.  4: 3 minutes.  5: High confidence.

The best helpers the language has.  —And the church, Father Moran?  —The church too. Coming round too. The work is going ahead there too. Don't fret about the church.  Bah! he had done well to leave the room in disdain. He had done well not to salute her on the steps of the library! He had done well to leave her to flirt with her priest, to toy with a church which was the scullery-maid of christendom.  Rude brutal anger routed the last lingering instant of ecstasy from his soul. It broke up violently her fair image and flung the fragments on all sides. On all sides distorted reflections of her image started from his memory: the flower girl in the ragged dress with damp coarse hair and a hoyden's face who had called herself his own girl and begged his handsel, the kitchen-girl in the next house who sang over the clatter of her plates, with the drawl of a country singer, the first bars of BY KILLARNEY'S LAKES AND FELLS, a girl who had laughed gaily to see him stumble when the iron grating in the footpath near Cork Hill had caught the broken sole of his shoe, a girl he had glanced at, attracted by her small ripe mouth, as she passed out of Jacob's biscuit factory, who had cried to him over her shoulder:  —Do you like what you seen of me, straight hair and curly eyebrows? 	1.5	5	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: This passage is a stream-of-consciousness reflection on a woman and various other women the narrator has encountered.  2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the passage covers a lot of ground in the narrator's memory.

366	JoycJA.txt|324|u	 His step was angry and with an angry abrupt gesture he thrust the stick back into Stephen's hand. Stephen felt that his anger had another cause but, feigning patience, touched his arm slightly and said quietly:  —Cranly, I told you I wanted to speak to you. Come away.  Cranly looked at him for a few moments and asked:  —Now?  —Yes, now, Stephen said. We can't speak here. Come away.  They crossed the quadrangle together without speaking. The bird call from SIEGFRIED whistled softly followed them from the steps of the porch. Cranly turned, and Dixon, who had whistled, called out:  —Where are you fellows off to? What about that game, Cranly?  They parleyed in shouts across the still air about a game of billiards to be played in the Adelphi hotel. Stephen walked on alone and out into the quiet of Kildare Street opposite Maple's hotel he stood to wait, patient again. The name of the hotel, a colourless polished wood, and its colourless front stung him like a glance of polite disdain. He stared angrily back at the softly lit drawing-room of the hotel in which he imagined the sleek lives of the patricians of Ireland housed in calm. They thought of army commissions and land agents: peasants greeted them along the roads in the country; they knew the names of certain French dishes and gave orders to jarvies in high-pitched provincial voices which pierced through their skin-tight accents. 	10.0	15	[3, 1, 2, 0]	VALID	1: Stephen and Cranly have an argument, and Stephen convinces Cranly to leave with him. They cross a quadrangle and are called to by Dixon, who asks about a game of billiards. Stephen then walks alone to Kildare Street and thinks about the hotel across the street. 2: The events described in the passage are mostly walking and thinking, which could take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour. The conversation with Dixon might take a few minutes.  3: Let's say 15 minutes have elapsed.  4: 15 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

She asked me why I never came, said she had heard all sorts of stories about me. This was only to gain time. Asked me was I writing poems? About whom? I asked her. This confused her more and I felt sorry and mean. Turned off that valve at once and opened the spiritual-heroic refrigerating apparatus, invented and patented in all countries by Dante Alighieri. Talked rapidly of myself and my plans. In the midst of it unluckily I made a sudden gesture of a revolutionary nature. I must have looked like a fellow throwing a handful of peas into the air. People began to look at us. She shook hands a moment after and, in going away, said she hoped I would do what I said.  Now I call that friendly, don't you?  Yes, I liked her today. A little or much? Don't know. I liked her and it seems a new feeling to me. Then, in that case, all the rest, all that I thought I thought and all that I felt I felt, all the rest before now, in fact...

And the air is thick with their company as they call to me, their kinsman, making ready to go, shaking the wings of their exultant and terrible youth.  APRIL 26.

Dublin, 1904  Trieste, 1914      	2880.0	30	[3, 0, 1, 2]	VALID	1: This passage is a collection of thoughts and images, including a description of the allure of travel and adventure, a reference to a mother putting clothes in order, a prayer for learning about the heart, and a reference to an old father and artificer. There are also two dates and locations given at the end. 2: There is no explicit reference to time passing in the scene, but the passage seems to cover a range of thoughts and images that could take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or more. 3: Let's estimate that the passage covers 30 minutes of time. 4: 30 minutes. 5: Low confidence, as the passage is more about thoughts and images than concrete actions.
369	greatexpectations.txt|0|u	  GREAT EXPECTATIONS  [1867 Edition]  by Charles Dickens  Chapter I  My father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.  I give Pirrip as my father's family name, on the authority of his tombstone and my sister,--Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith. As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of either of them (for their days were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on my father's, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man, with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription, 'Also Georgiana Wife of the Above,' I drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of mine,--who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in that universal struggle,--I am indebted for a belief I religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of existence. 	5256000.0	5256000	[3, 0, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator introduces himself as Pip and explains that he never knew his parents, but derived fanciful ideas about them from their tombstones. He also describes the tombstones of his five deceased brothers. 2: The passage describes the narrator's childhood and his imaginative musings about his family. There is no explicit reference to time, but the narrator's childhood and the fact that photographs were not yet invented suggest that this is set in the 19th century. Let's say the narrator is around 10 years old, so the events described span about a decade. 3: 10 years have elapsed. At 365 days a year that's 3650 days x 24 hours in a day, so 87600 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 5256000 minutes. 4: 5256000 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
370	greatexpectations.txt|1|u	 Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river wound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out for certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard; and that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also Georgiana wife of the above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the aforesaid, were also dead and buried; and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard, intersected with dikes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond was the river; and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was rushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.  'Hold your noise!' cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from among the graves at the side of the church porch. 'Keep still, you little devil, or I'll cut your throat!'  A fearful man, all in coarse gray, with a great iron on his leg. A man with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his head. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by briars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin. 	1.0	0	[1, 0, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator describes his first vivid impression of the landscape around him, including the churchyard, marshes, river, and sea. He is then accosted by a frightening man. 2: The passage describes a single moment in time, when the narrator is a child and has a sudden realization about the landscape around him. The encounter with the man is brief and does not involve any significant passage of time.  3: No time has elapsed. 4: 0 minutes. 5: High confidence.
371	greatexpectations.txt|119|u	 It opened to the ground, and looked into a most miserable corner of the neglected garden, upon a rank ruin of cabbage-stalks, and one box-tree that had been clipped round long ago, like a pudding, and had a new growth at the top of it, out of shape and of a different color, as if that part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt. This was my homely thought, as I contemplated the box-tree. There had been some light snow, overnight, and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge; but, it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of garden, and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the window, as if it pelted me for coming there.  I divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room, and that its other occupants were looking at me. I could see nothing of the room except the shining of the fire in the window-glass, but I stiffened in all my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection.  There were three ladies in the room and one gentleman. Before I had been standing at the window five minutes, they somehow conveyed to me that they were all toadies and humbugs, but that each of them pretended not to know that the others were toadies and humbugs: because the admission that he or she did know it, would have made him or her out to be a toady and humbug. 	4.0	10	[3, 0, 1, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator looks out a window at a neglected garden, and then senses that they are being watched by three women and a man in a room. The occupants of the room are described as toadies and humbugs. 2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the description of the snow suggests that it is winter. The narrator also stands at the window for five minutes. Let's say the whole scene takes 10 minutes. 3: 10 minutes have elapsed. 4: 10 minutes. 5: High confidence.
372	greatexpectations.txt|187|u	 Biddy's first triumph in her new office, was to solve a difficulty that had completely vanquished me. I had tried hard at it, but had made nothing of it. Thus it was:--  Again and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, a character that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly wanted. I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T, from tar to toast and tub. At length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in my sister's ear, she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent. Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, one after another, but without avail. Then I bethought me of a crutch, the shape being much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, and displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence. But she shook her head to that extent when she was shown it, that we were terrified lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck.  When my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her, this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate. Biddy looked thoughtfully at it, heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my sister, looked thoughtfully at Joe (who was always represented on the slate by his initial letter), and ran into the forge, followed by Joe and me. 	1440.0	2	[1, 3, 2, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator's sister has been drawing a mysterious T-like symbol on a slate, and the narrator has been unable to figure out what it means. Biddy, a new helper, is able to understand the symbol and leads the narrator and Joe to the forge. 2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage. The events described are relatively brief, taking place over the course of a few minutes at most. 3: Let's say 2 minutes have elapsed. 4: 2 minutes. 5: High confidence.
373	greatexpectations.txt|192|u	 What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work? I sat silent, recalling what a drudge she had been until Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living, so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people. I recalled the hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school, with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and shouldered. I reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in Biddy what was now developing, for, in my first uneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help, as a matter of course. Biddy sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while I looked at her and thought about it all, it occurred to me that perhaps I had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy. I might have been too reserved, and should have patronized her more (though I did not use that precise word in my meditations) with my confidence.  'Yes, Biddy,' I observed, when I had done turning it over, 'you were my first teacher, and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like this, in this kitchen.'  'Ah, poor thing!' replied Biddy. It was like her self-forgetfulness to transfer the remark to my sister, and to get up and be busy about her, making her more comfortable; 'that's sadly true!' 	5.0	1051200	[3, 1, 0, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator reflects on his past relationship with Biddy, a woman who had helped him in the past.  2: The passage describes the narrator's memories of Biddy's past and his own past, but there is no explicit reference to time. We can guess that the memories span a few years, but it's difficult to be more precise.  3: Let's say that the memories span two years. At 365 days a year that's 730 days. 24 hours in a day, so 17520 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 1,051,200 minutes. 4: 1,051,200 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the estimate is based on a guess.

'I don't take to Philip,' said he, smiling, 'for it sounds like a moral boy out of the spelling-book, who was so lazy that he fell into a pond, or so fat that he couldn't see out of his eyes, or so avaricious that he locked up his cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go a bird's-nesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in the neighborhood. I tell you what I should like. We are so harmonious, and you have been a blacksmith,---would you mind it?'  'I shouldn't mind anything that you propose,' I answered, 'but I don't understand you.'  'Would you mind Handel for a familiar name? There's a charming piece of music by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith.'  'I should like it very much.'  'Then, my dear Handel,' said he, turning round as the door opened, 'here is the dinner, and I must beg of you to take the top of the table, because the dinner is of your providing.'  This I would not hear of, so he took the top, and I faced him. It was a nice little dinner,--seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor's Feast,--and it acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent circumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us. 	45.0	120	[2, 1, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The speaker and his companion discuss what to call each other, and then have dinner.  2: There are no explicit references to time, but the events described seem to take place in real time. The conversation about names might take a few minutes, and dinner might take an hour or two. Let's say two hours.  3: Two hours have elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour that's 120 minutes. 4: 120 minutes. 5: High confidence.
375	greatexpectations.txt|393|u	 We had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mr. Wopsle; but they were too hopeless to be persisted in. Therefore we had sat, feeling keenly for him, but laughing, nevertheless, from ear to ear. I laughed in spite of myself all the time, the whole thing was so droll; and yet I had a latent impression that there was something decidedly fine in Mr. Wopsle's elocution,--not for old associations' sake, I am afraid, but because it was very slow, very dreary, very uphill and downhill, and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural circumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything. When the tragedy was over, and he had been called for and hooted, I said to Herbert, 'Let us go at once, or perhaps we shall meet him.'  We made all the haste we could downstairs, but we were not quick enough either. Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavy smear of eyebrow, who caught my eyes as we advanced, and said, when we came up with him,--  'Mr. Pip and friend?'  Identity of Mr. Pip and friend confessed.  'Mr. Waldengarver,' said the man, 'would be glad to have the honor.'  'Waldengarver?' I repeated--when Herbert murmured in my ear, 'Probably Wopsle.'  'Oh!' said I. 'Yes. Shall we follow you?'  'A few steps, please.' When we were in a side alley, he turned and asked, 'How did you think he looked?--I dressed him.' 	60.0	190	[3, 0, 1, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator and Herbert attend a play where Mr. Wopsle performs poorly. They leave the theater and are approached by a man who invites them to meet someone named Waldengarver.  2: The events in the theater probably took a few hours. The time elapsed between leaving the theater and being approached by the man is not specified, but it seems like it would be a matter of minutes.  3: Let's say 3 hours for the theater performance and 10 minutes for the encounter with the man. That's 180 + 10 = 190 minutes. 4: 190 minutes. 5: High confidence.

'Mr. Pip,' he replied, with gravity, 'Walworth is one place, and this office is another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers is another. They must not be confounded together. My Walworth sentiments must be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be taken in this office.'  'Very well,' said I, much relieved, 'then I shall look you up at Walworth, you may depend upon it.'  'Mr. Pip,' he returned, 'you will be welcome there, in a private and personal capacity.'  We had held this conversation in a low voice, well knowing my guardian's ears to be the sharpest of the sharp. As he now appeared in his doorway, towelling his hands, Wemmick got on his great-coat and stood by to snuff out the candles. We all three went into the street together, and from the door-step Wemmick turned his way, and Mr. Jaggers and I turned ours.  I could not help wishing more than once that evening, that Mr. Jaggers had had an Aged in Gerrard Street, or a Stinger, or a Something, or a Somebody, to unbend his brows a little. It was an uncomfortable consideration on a twenty-first birthday, that coming of age at all seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he made of it. He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than Wemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to dinner. And Mr. Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy, because, after he was gone, Herbert said of himself, with his eyes fixed on the fire, that he thought he must have committed a felony and forgotten the details of it, he felt so dejected and guilty. 	180.0	120	[0, 1, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator has a conversation with Wemmick and Mr. Jaggers, in which Wemmick distinguishes between his personal and professional opinions. They leave the office together and the narrator reflects on Mr. Jaggers' character. 2: There are no explicit references to time, but the events described seem to take place over the course of a single evening. Let's say two hours. 3: Two hours have elapsed. 60 minutes in an hour, so 120 minutes. 4: 120 minutes. 5: High confidence.
377	greatexpectations.txt|504|u	 I lighted my fire, which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of the morning, and fell into a doze before it. I seemed to have been dozing a whole night when the clocks struck six. As there was full an hour and a half between me and daylight, I dozed again; now, waking up uneasily, with prolix conversations about nothing, in my ears; now, making thunder of the wind in the chimney; at length, falling off into a profound sleep from which the daylight woke me with a start.  All this time I had never been able to consider my own situation, nor could I do so yet. I had not the power to attend to it. I was greatly dejected and distressed, but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way. As to forming any plan for the future, I could as soon have formed an elephant. When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild morning, all of a leaden hue; when I walked from room to room; when I sat down again shivering, before the fire, waiting for my laundress to appear; I thought how miserable I was, but hardly knew why, or how long I had been so, or on what day of the week I made the reflection, or even who I was that made it. 	540.0	240	[0, 2, 1, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator wakes up early, dozes off and on, and is unable to focus on his situation.  2: The passage describes a period of time between the narrator waking up and daylight arriving. There is no explicit reference to how long this period is, but it seems to be several hours. Let's say four hours.  3: Four hours have elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour, that's 240 minutes.  4: 240 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

Others has done it safe afore, and what others has done afore, others can do agen. As to the where and how of living, dear boy, give me your own opinions on it.'  'You take it smoothly now,' said I, 'but you were very serious last night, when you swore it was Death.'  'And so I swear it is Death,' said he, putting his pipe back in his mouth, 'and Death by the rope, in the open street not fur from this, and it's serious that you should fully understand it to be so. What then, when that's once done? Here I am. To go back now 'ud be as bad as to stand ground--worse. Besides, Pip, I'm here, because I've meant it by you, years and years. As to what I dare, I'm a old bird now, as has dared all manner of traps since first he was fledged, and I'm not afeerd to perch upon a scarecrow. If there's Death hid inside of it, there is, and let him come out, and I'll face him, and then I'll believe in him and not afore. And now let me have a look at my gentleman agen.'  Once more, he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of admiring proprietorship: smoking with great complacency all the while. 	2.0	5	[1, 3, 0, 2]	VALID	1: The speaker is trying to convince the narrator that he can disguise himself and evade the law. He insists that he is serious about the danger he is in, but that he is willing to face it.  2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage. The speaker does mention that he has meant to be with the narrator for 'years and years,' but this is not a clear reference to the time that has passed in the scene. The passage is mostly dialogue, so there is little description to imply the passage of time. We can guess that the conversation takes at least a few minutes, but it's hard to say for sure. Let's say 5 minutes.  3: 5 minutes have elapsed.  4: 5 minutes.  5: Low confidence, because the estimate is based on a guess about how long the conversation takes.
379	greatexpectations.txt|513|u	 As he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit, in which he looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I next discussed with him what dress he should wear. He cherished an extraordinary belief in the virtues of 'shorts' as a disguise, and had in his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made him something between a dean and a dentist. It was with considerable difficulty that I won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a prosperous farmer's; and we arranged that he should cut his hair close, and wear a little powder. Lastly, as he had not yet been seen by the laundress or her niece, he was to keep himself out of their view until his change of dress was made.  It would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions; but in my dazed, not to say distracted, state, it took so long, that I did not get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon. He was to remain shut up in the chambers while I was gone, and was on no account to open the door. 	300.0	180	[2, 1, 0, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator discusses with someone how to disguise themselves, and then leaves for a few hours while the other person stays inside.  2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but the narrator leaves 'two or three in the afternoon' and returns at an undefined time later. Let's say the narrator is gone for three hours.  3: Three hours have elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour that's 180 minutes. 4: 180 minutes. 5: High confidence.

Lord strike you dead on the spot, if ever you split in any way sumever! Kiss it!'  'Do so, as he wishes it,' I said to Herbert. So, Herbert, looking at me with a friendly uneasiness and amazement, complied, and Provis immediately shaking hands with him, said, 'Now you're on your oath, you know. And never believe me on mine, if Pip shan't make a gentleman on you!'     Chapter XLI  In vain should I attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet of Herbert, when he and I and Provis sat down before the fire, and I recounted the whole of the secret. Enough, that I saw my own feelings reflected in Herbert's face, and not least among them, my repugnance towards the man who had done so much for me.  What would alone have set a division between that man and us, if there had been no other dividing circumstance, was his triumph in my story. Saving his troublesome sense of having been 'low' on one occasion since his return,--on which point he began to hold forth to Herbert, the moment my revelation was finished,--he had no perception of the possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune. His boast that he had made me a gentleman, and that he had come to see me support the character on his ample resources, was made for me quite as much as for himself. And that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us, and that we must both be very proud of it, was a conclusion quite established in his own mind. 	60.0	3	[3, 2, 1, 0]	VALID	1: Provis gives Herbert a black book and makes him swear an oath. Later, the narrator tells Herbert about Provis's role in his life, and Herbert is astonished and uneasy. 2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage. The events described take place in a single location and are mostly dialogue, so they probably take place in a few minutes.  3: Let's say three minutes have elapsed.  4: 3 minutes. 5: High confidence.
381	greatexpectations.txt|559|u	 I dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself better than I could have expected, considering what agony it gave me to hear her say those words. When I raised my face again, there was such a ghastly look upon Miss Havisham's, that it impressed me, even in my passionate hurry and grief.  'Estella, dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead you into this fatal step. Put me aside for ever,--you have done so, I well know,--but bestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle. Miss Havisham gives you to him, as the greatest slight and injury that could be done to the many far better men who admire you, and to the few who truly love you. Among those few there may be one who loves you even as dearly, though he has not loved you as long, as I. Take him, and I can bear it better, for your sake!'  My earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have been touched with compassion, if she could have rendered me at all intelligible to her own mind.  'I am going,' she said again, in a gentler voice, 'to be married to him. The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall be married soon. Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by adoption? It is my own act.'  'Your own act, Estella, to fling yourself away upon a brute?' 	2.0	5	[0, 3, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The speaker is pleading with Estella not to marry Drummle, and to choose someone who loves her. Estella insists that she is marrying of her own accord. 2: There is no explicit reference to time. The conversation is intense and emotional, but it's hard to say how long it would take. Let's say it takes five minutes. 3: 5 minutes have elapsed. 4: 5 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
382	greatexpectations.txt|677|u	 'Ah,' said he, shaking his head gravely. 'But you don't know it equal to me. You must have been under lock and key, dear boy, to know it equal to me,--but I ain't a going to be low.'  It occurred to me as inconsistent, that, for any mastering idea, he should have endangered his freedom, and even his life. But I reflected that perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the habit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man. I was not far out, since he said, after smoking a little:--  'You see, dear boy, when I was over yonder, t'other side the world, I was always a looking to this side; and it come flat to be there, for all I was a growing rich. Everybody knowed Magwitch, and Magwitch could come, and Magwitch could go, and nobody's head would be troubled about him. They ain't so easy concerning me here, dear boy,--wouldn't be, leastwise, if they knowed where I was.'  'If all goes well,' said I, 'you will be perfectly free and safe again within a few hours.'  'Well,' he returned, drawing a long breath, 'I hope so.'  'And think so?' 	2.0	300	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: Two characters are having a conversation about one of them being in danger. The character in danger reflects on his past and his current situation.  2: There are no explicit references to time. The conversation seems to be happening in real time, so let's say it takes about five minutes.  3: 5 minutes have elapsed. Multiplying by 60 minutes in an hour, that's 300 minutes. 4: 300 minutes. 5: High confidence.
383	greatexpectations.txt|754|u	'But you said to me,' returned Estella, very earnestly, ''God bless you, God forgive you!' And if you could say that to me then, you will not hesitate to say that to me now,--now, when suffering has been stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be. I have been bent and broken, but--I hope--into a better shape. Be as considerate and good to me as you were, and tell me we are friends.' 'We are friends,' said I, rising and bending over her, as she rose from the bench. 'And will continue friends apart,' said Estella. I took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and, as the morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so the evening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of tranquil light they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting from her.	2.0	10	[2, 0, 1, 3]	VALID	1: The speaker and Estella have a conversation in which Estella asks for the speaker's friendship. The speaker agrees, and they leave a ruined place together.  2: There are no explicit references to time, but the speaker notes that the morning mists had risen long ago when he first left the forge, and now the evening mists are rising. This suggests that at least a full day has passed. However, the conversation itself is brief and could take place in a matter of minutes. Let's say 10 minutes.  3: 10 minutes have elapsed.  4: 10 minutes.  5: High confidence.

'PEACE to the spirits of my honoured parents, respected be their remains, and immortalized their virtues! may time, while it moulders their frail relicks to dust, commit to tradition the record of their goodness; and Oh may their orphan-descendant be influenced through life by the remembrance of their purity, and be solaced in death, that by her it was unsullied!' Such was the secret prayer with which the only survivor of the Beverley family quitted the abode of her youth, and residence of her forefathers; while tears of recollecting sorrow filled her eyes, and obstructed  the last view of her native town which had excited them. Cecilia, this fair traveller, had lately entered into the one-and-twentieth year of her age. Her ancestors had been rich farmers in the county of Suffolk, though her father, in whom a spirit of elegance had supplanted the rapacity of wealth, had spent his time as a private country gentleman, satisfied, without increasing his store, to live upon what he inherited from the labours of his predecessors. She had lost him in her early youth, and her mother had not long survived him. They had bequeathed to her 10,000 l. and consigned her to the care of the Dean of , her uncle. With this gentleman, in whom, by various contingencies, the accumulated possessions of a rising and prosperous family were centred, she had passed the last four years of her life; and a few weeks only had yet elapsed since his death, which, by depriving her of her last relation, made her heiress to an estate of 3000 l. per annum; with no other restriction than that of annexing her name, if she married, to the disposal of her hand and her riches. 	11037600.0	86400	[0, 1, 2, 3]	VALID	1: The passage introduces the protagonist, Cecilia, who has just left her hometown after the deaths of her parents and uncle. She is now an orphan and a wealthy heiress. 2: The passage describes Cecilia's recent past, including the deaths of her parents and uncle, and her inheritance. It's unclear how much time has passed since her uncle's death, but it seems to be a matter of weeks or months rather than years. Let's say two months. 3: Two months have elapsed. At 30 days a month that's 60 days x 24 hours in a day, so 1440 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 86400 minutes. 4: 86400 minutes. 5: High confidence.
386	BurnFCO.txt|1|u	But though thus largely indebted to fortune, to nature she had yet greater obligations: her form was elegant, her heart was liberal; her countenance announced the intelligence  of her mind, her complexion varied with every emotion of her soul, and her eyes, the heralds of her speech, now beamed with understanding and now glistened with sensibility. For the short period of her minority, the management of her fortune and the care of her person, had by the Dean been entrusted to three guardians, among whom her own choice was to settle her residence: but her mind, saddened by the loss of all her natural friends, coveted to regain its serenity in the quietness of the country, and in the bosom of an aged and maternal counsellor, whom she loved as her mother, and to whom she had been known from her childhood. The Deanery, indeed, she was obliged to relinquish, a long repining expectant being eager, by entering it, to bequeath to another the anxiety and suspence he had suffered himself; though probably without much impatience to shorten their duration in favour of the next successor; but the house of Mrs. Charlton, her benevolent friend, was open for her reception, and the alleviating tenderness of her conversation took from her all wish of changing it. Here she had dwelt since the interment of her uncle; and here, from the affectionate gratitude of her disposition, she had perhaps  been content to dwell till her own, had not her guardians interfered to remove her. 	45360.0	129600	[1, 0, 3, 2]	VALID	1: The passage describes a woman who is beautiful, intelligent, and wealthy. She has lost her natural friends and has been entrusted to guardians, but she chooses to live with an elderly woman who has been like a mother to her. She has been living with this woman since the death of her uncle, and would have been content to stay there longer if her guardians had not interfered. 2: There are no explicit references to time in the passage. However, the woman has been living with Mrs. Charlton since the death of her uncle, which suggests that some time has passed. It's unclear how long this has been, but it's likely been at least a few months. Let's say three months. 3: Three months have elapsed. At 30 days a month that's 90 days. 24 hours in a day, so 2160 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 129600 minutes. 4: 129600 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the estimate is based on speculation about how long the woman has been living with Mrs. Charlton.

About half an hour ago I called upon him again; he was then just returned home.' 'Well, Sir?' 'I saw him; the affair was over; and in a short time he will be able, if you will allow him so much honour, to thank you for these enquiries.' 'He is then wounded?' 'He is a little hurt, but Sir Robert is perfectly safe. Belfield fired first, and missed; the Baronet was not so successless.' 'I am grieved to hear it, indeed! and where is the wound?' 'The ball entered his right side, and the moment he felt it, he fired his second pistol in the air. This I heard from his servant. He was brought home carefully and slowly; no surgeon had been upon the  spot, but one was called to him immediately. I stayed to enquire his opinion after the wound had been dressed: he told me he had extracted the ball, and assured me Mr. Belfield was not in any danger. Your alarm, madam, last night, which had always been present to me, then encouraged me to take the liberty of waiting upon you; for I concluded you could yet have had no certain intelligence, and thought it best to let the plain and simple fact out-run the probable exaggeration of rumour.' 	2.0	120	[1, 2, 0, 3]	VALID	1: A man reports to a woman that he has seen a man who was involved in a duel. The man was wounded but is expected to recover.  2: The passage describes a conversation between two people, with no explicit reference to time. The man reports that he saw the other man 'about half an hour ago,' but this is not a reliable indicator of how much time has passed since the duel. We can guess that the duel and its aftermath might have taken a few hours, but this is speculative. Let's say two hours.  3: Two hours have elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour that's 120 minutes. 4: 120 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because of the speculative nature of the estimate.
388	BurnFCO.txt|359|u	'Your rejection, therefore,' continued he, 'of this honourable offer, may perhaps have been merely the consequence of  the principles in which you have been educated. 'Rejection?' interrupted Cecilia, amazed, 'what rejection, Sir?' 'Have you not refused the proposals of my Lord Ernolf for his son?' 'Lord Ernolf? never! nor have I ever seen either his Lordship or his son but in public.' 'That,' replied Mr. Delvile, 'is little to the purpose; where the connexion is a proper one, a young lady of delicacy has only to accede to it. But though this rejection came not immediately from yourself, it had doubtless your concurrence.' 'It had not, Sir, even my knowledge.' 'Your alliance then with Sir Robert Floyer is probably nearer a conclusion than I had imagined, for otherwise Mr. Harrel would not, without consulting you, have given the Earl so determinate an answer. 'No, Sir,' said Cecilia, impatiently, 'my alliance with him was never more distant, nor do I mean it should ever approach more near.' She was now little disposed for further conversation. Her heroic design of refusing young Delvile by no means reconciled her to the discovery she now made that he had not meant to address her; and though she was provoked and fretted at this new proof  that Mr. Harrel scrupled neither assertions nor actions to make her engagement with Sir Robert credited, her disappointment in finding that Mr. Delvile, instead of pleading the cause of his son, was exerting his interest for another person, affected her so much more nearly, that notwithstanding he still continued his parading harangue, she scarcely knew even the subject of his discourse, and seized the first opportunity of a cessation to rise and take her leave. 	3.3	10	[0, 2, 3, 1]	VALID	1: Cecilia is accused of rejecting a proposal from Lord Ernolf for his son, which she denies. Mr. Delvile suggests that Cecilia's alliance with Sir Robert Floyer is closer than she admits. Cecilia is upset by the conversation and leaves. 2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage. The events described take place in a conversation, which could take place over a few minutes or a few hours. Let's assume it takes place over 10 minutes. 3: 10 minutes have elapsed. 4: 10 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

'Yes; but not more than it costs his neighbours to keep him in countenance. Miss Leeson, since she has presided over the sect of the SUPERCILIOUS, spends at least half her life in wishing the annihilation of the other half; for as she must only speak in her own Coterie, she is compelled to be frequently silent, and therefore, having nothing to think of, she is commonly gnawn with self-denial, and soured with want of amusement: Miss Larolles, indeed, is better off, for in talking faster than she thinks, she has but followed the natural bent of her disposition: as to this poor JARGONIST, he has, I must own, rather a hard task, from the continual restraint of speaking only out of his own Liliputian vocabulary, and denying himself the relief of ever uttering one word by the call of occasion: but what hardship is that, compared with what is borne by Mr. Meadows? who, since he commenced INSENSIBLIST, has never once dared to be  pleased, nor ventured for a moment to look in good humour!' 'Surely, then,' said Cecilia, 'in a short time, the punishment of this affectation will bring its cure.' 	2.0	0	[0, 3, 1, 2]	CALC ERROR	1: Two characters discuss the affectations of their acquaintances, including a man who speaks only in a limited vocabulary and another who never expresses pleasure. 2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time.

However, the passage doesn't give any indication of how long these habits have been in place.  3: N/A 4: N/A 5: High confidence that no time is described in the passage.

'And if I should,' cried he, 'half of it, at least, would thank me; and to obtain the applause of so noble an assembly, what would it signify that Sir Robert should cut my throat?' 'I believe,' said Cecilia, deeply mortified by a raillery that shewed so little interest in her avowal of indifference, 'you are determined to make me as sick of that man's name, as I am of his conversation.' 'And is it possible,' exclaimed Delvile, in a tone of surprise, 'that such can be your opinion, and yet, situated as you are, the whole world at your command, and all mankind at your devotion but I am answering you seriously, when you are only speaking by rule.' 'What rule, Sir?' 'That which young ladies, upon certain occasions, always prescribe themselves.' Here they were interrupted by the arrival of the rest of the company; though not before Cecilia had received some little consolation for her displeasure, by finding that young Delvile still supposed she was engaged, and flattering herself his language would be different were he informed of the contrary. 	2.0	5	[1, 0, 2, 3]	VALID	1: Cecilia and Delvile are having a conversation in which Cecilia is upset that Delvile is not more interested in her. The conversation is interrupted by the arrival of other people.  2: There is no explicit reference to time. The conversation seems to be brief, but there is no way to know for sure.

'Why, Sir, this will prove an expensive expedition to you,' said Mr. Gosport, very gravely; 'Have you cast up what it may cost you?' 'More than it's worth, more than it's worth,' answered he pettishly; 'ha'n't laid out so much in pleasure these five years.' 'Ha! ha!' cried Morrice, hallowing aloud, why it can't be more than sixpence in all!' 'Sixpence?' repeated he scornfully, 'if you don't know the value of sixpence, you'll never be worth fivepence three farthings. How do think got rich, hay? by wearing fine coats, and frizzling my pate? No, no; Master Harrel for that! ask him if he'll cast an account with me! never knew a man worth a penny with such a coat as that on.' Morrice again laughed, and again Mr. Briggs reproved him; and Cecilia, taking advantage of the squabble, stole back to the music-room. Here, in a few minutes, Mrs. Panton, a lady who frequently visited at the house, approached Cecilia, followed by a gentleman, whom she had never before seen, but  who was so evidently charmed with her, that he had looked at no other object since his entrance into the house. Mrs. Panton, presenting him to her by the name of Mr. Marriot, told her he had begged her intercession for the honour of her hand in the two first dances: and the moment she answered that she was already engaged, the same request was made for the two following. Cecilia had then no excuse, and was therefore obliged to accept him. 	11.0	120	[1, 3, 0, 2]	VALID	1: A group of people are discussing the cost of a coat and waistcoat. Cecilia leaves the group and is approached by a man named Mr. Marriot, who asks to dance with her. 2: There are no explicit references to time in the passage. The events described, however, seem to take place in a relatively short period of time, perhaps an hour or two. 3: Let's say two hours have elapsed. 4: 120 minutes. 5: High confidence.

I must go and try another atmosphere, But I hope you will relent, and dance?' And then, stretching his arms as if half asleep, he sauntered into the next room, where he flung himself upon a sofa till the ball was over. The new partner of Cecilia, who was a wealthy, but very simple young man, used his utmost efforts to entertain and oblige her, and, flattered by the warmth of his own desire, he fancied that he succeeded; though, in a state of such suspence and anxiety, a man of brighter talents had failed. At the end of the two dances, Lord Ernolf again attempted to engage her for his son, but she now excused herself from dancing any more, and sat quietly as a spectatress till the rest of the company gave over. Mr. Marriot, however, would not quit her, and she was compelled to support with him a trifling conversation, which, though irksome to herself, to him, who had not seen her in her happier hour, was delightful. She expected every instant to be again joined by young Delvile, but the expectation was disappointed; he came not; she concluded he was in another apartment; the company was summoned to supper, she then thought it impossible to miss him; but, after waiting and looking for him in  vain, she found he had already left the house. 	120.0	60	[0, 2, 1, 3]	VALID	1: A man unsuccessfully tries to convince Cecilia to dance with his son, then leaves the ball early. Cecilia dances with another man, but is disappointed when the man she really wants to see doesn't show up.  2: There are two dances described, which probably take 10-20 minutes each. The man who leaves early does so immediately after the second dance. Cecilia waits for her preferred partner for some time, but it's unclear how long.

And, when she hesitated in her compliance, he suriously accused her of having brought on  all this distress by her negligence and want of management, and declared that if she did not get the money, she would only be served as she merited by starving in a foreign gaol, which he swore would be the fate of them both. The horror and indignation with which Cecilia heard this account were unspeakable. She saw evidently that she was again to be played upon by terror and distress, and the cautions and opinions of Mr. Monckton no longer appeared overstrained; one year's income was already demanded, the annuity and the country house might next be required: she rejoiced, however, that thus wisely forwarned, she was not liable to surprise, and she determined, be their entreaties or representations what they might, to be immovably steady in her purpose of leaving them the next morning. Yet she could not but grieve at suffering the whole burthen of this clamorous imposition to fall upon the soft-hearted Mr. Arnott, whose inability to resist solicitation made him so unequal to sustaining its weight: but when Mrs. Harrel was again able to go on with her account, she heard, to her infinite surprise, that all application to her brother had proved fruitless. 'He will not hear me,' continued Mrs. Harrel, 'and he never was deaf to me before! so  now I have lost my only and last resource, my brother himself gives me up, and there is no one else upon earth who will assist me!' 	1440.0	180	[0, 2, 3, 1]	VALID	1: Cecilia is listening to Mrs. Harrel's account of her husband's financial demands.

THE next morning the family purposed setting off as soon as breakfast was over: young Delvile, however, waited not so long; the fineness of the weather tempted him, he said, to travel on horseback, and therefore he had risen very early, and was already gone. Cecilia could not but wonder, yet did not repine. Just as breakfast was over, and Mr. and Mrs. Delvile and Cecilia were preparing to depart, to their no little surprise, the door was opened, and, out of breath with haste and with heat, in stumpt Mr. Briggs! 'So,' cried he, to Cecilia, 'what's all this? hay? where are going? a coach at the door! horses to every wheel! Servants fine as lords! what's in the wind now? think to chouse me out of my belongings?' 'I thought, Sir,' said Cecilia, who instantly understood him, though Mr. and Mrs. Delvile stared at him in utter astonishment, 'I had explained before I left you that I should not return.'  'Did n't, did n't!' answered he, angrily; 'waited for you three days, dressed a breast o' mutton o' purpose; got in a lobster, and two crabs; all spoilt by keeping; stink already; weather quite muggy, forced to souse 'em in vinegar; one expence brings on another; never begin the like agen.' 'I am very sorry, indeed,' said Cecilia, much disconcerted, 'if there has been any mistake through my neglect; but I had hoped I was understood, and I have been so much occupied ' 	180.0	45	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: Young Delvile leaves early in the morning on horseback.

She saw throughout the whole behaviour of Mrs. Delvile, a warmth of regard which, though strongly opposed by family pride, made her almost miserable to promote the very union she thought necessary to discountenance; she saw, too, that it was with the utmost difficulty she preserved the steadiness of her opposition, and that she had a conflict perpetual with herself, to forbear openly acknowledging the contrariety of her wishes, and the perplexity of her distress; but chiefly she was struck with her expressive use of the word gratitude. 'Wherefore should she be grateful, thought Cecilia, what have I done, or had power to do? infinitely, indeed, is she deceived, if she supposes that her son has acted by my directions; my influence with him is nothing, and he could not be more his own master, were he utterly indifferent to me. To conceal my own disappointment has been all I have attempted; and perhaps she may think of me thus highly, from supposing that the firmness of her son is owing to my caution and reserve: ah, she knows him not! were my heart at this moment laid open to him, were all its weakness, its partiality, its ill-fated admiration displayed, he would but double his vigilance to avoid and forget me, and find  the task all the easier by his abatement of esteem. Oh strange infatuation of unconquerable prejudice! his very life will sacrifice in preference to his name, a while the conflict of his mind threatens t level him with the dust, he disdains to unit himself where one wish is unsatisfied!' 	60.0	0	[1, 0, 2, 3]	CALC ERROR	1: Cecilia is surprised by Mrs. Delvile's behavior, which seems to indicate a desire for Cecilia to marry her son.

What next, thought Cecilia, trembling at this introduction, is preparing for me! does he mean to ask me to solicit Mrs. Delvile's consent! or from myself must he receive commands that we should never meet more! 'Is Miss Beverley,' cried he, 'determined not to speak to me? Is she bent upon silence only to intimidate me? Indeed if she knew how greatly I respect her, she would honour me with more confidence.' 'When, Sir,' cried she, 'do you mean to make your tour?' 'Never!' cried he, with fervour, 'unless banished by you, never! no, loveliest Miss Beverley, I can now quit you no more! Fortune, beauty, worth and sweetness I had power to relinquish, and severe as was the task, I compelled myself to perform it, but when to these I find joined so attractive a softness, a pity for my sufferings so unexpectedly gentle no! sweetest Miss Beverley, I can quit you no more!' And then, seizing her hand, with yet greater energy, he went on, 'I here,' he cried, 'offer you my vows, I here own you sole arbitress of my sate! I give you not merely the possession of my heart, that, indeed,  I had no power to with-hold from you, but I give you the direction of my conduct, I entreat you to become my counsellor and guide.

I have now adopted, though poor, the very plan of life I should have elected if rich; my pleasure, therefore, is become my business, and my business my pleasure.' 'And is this plan,' cried Monckton, 'nothing more than turning Knight-errant to the Booksellers?' ''Tis a Knight-errantry,' answered Belfield, laughing, 'which, however ludicrous it may seem to you, requires more soul and more brains than any other. Our giants may, indeed, be only windmills, but they must be attacked with as much spirit, and conquered with as much bravery, as any fort or any town, in time of war should be demolished; and though the siege, I must confess, may be of less national utility, the assailants of the quill have their honour as much at heart as the assailants of the sword.' 'I suppose then,' said Monckton, archly, 'if a man wants a biting lampoon, or an handsome panegyric, some news-paper scandal, or a a sonnet for a lady ' 'No, no,' interrupted Belfield eagerly,  'if you imagine me a hireling scribble for the purposes of defamation or of flattery, you as little know my situation as my character.

He then got up, took the children by their little hands, and went away.    CHAP. X. A TERMINATION. DR. Lyster and Delvile met them at the entrance into the house. Extremely alarmed lest Cecilia had received any disturbance, they both hastened up stairs, but Delvile proceeded only to the door. He stopt there and listened; but all was silent: the prayers of Albany had struck an awe into every one; and Dr. Lyster soon returned to tell him there was no alteration in his patient. 'And he has not disturbed her?' cried Delvile. 'No, not at all.' 'I think, then,' said he, advancing, though trembling, 'I will yet see her once more.' 'No, no, Mr. Mortimer,' cried the doctor, 'why should you give yourself so unnecessary a shock?' 'The shock,' answered he, 'is over! tell me, however, is there any chance I may hurt her?

399	BurnFCO.txt|1320|u	The tender-hearted Henrietta, in returning to her new friends, gave way, with artless openness, to the violence of untamed grief; but finding Mr. Arnott as wretched  as herself, the sympathy Cecilia had foreseen soon endeared them to each other, while the little interest taken in either by Mrs. Harrel, made them almost inseparable companions. Mrs. Harrel, wearied by their melancholy, and sick of retirement, took the earliest opportunity that was offered her of changing her situation; she married very soon a man of fortune in the neighbourhood, and, quickly forgetting all the past, thoughtlessly began the world again, with new hopes, new connections, new equipages and new engagements! Henrietta was then obliged to go again to her mother, where, though deprived of all the indulgencies to which she was now become familiar, she was not more hurt by the separation than Mr. Arnott. So sad and so solitary his house seemed in her absence, that he soon followed her to town, and returned not till he carried her back its mistress. And there the gentle gratitude of her soft and feeling heart, engaged from the worthy Mr. Arnott the tenderest affection, and, in time, healed the wound of his early and hopeless passion. The injudicious, the volatile, yet nobleminded Belfield, to whose mutable and enterprising disposition life seemed always rather beginning than progressive, roved from employment to employment, and from  public life to retirement, soured with the world, and discontented with himself, till vanquished, at length, by the constant friendship of Delvile, he consented to accept his good offices in again entering the army; and, being fortunately ordered out upon foreign service, his hopes were revived by ambition, and his prospects were brightened by a view of future honour. 	2628000.0	525600	[0, 3, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The passage describes the aftermath of Mrs. Harrel's marriage, which separates Henrietta from Mr. Arnott.

400	BurnFCO.txt|1321|u	The wretched Monckton, dupe of his own cunning and artifices, still lived in lingering misery, doubtful which was most acute, the pain of his wound and confinement, or of his defeat and disappointment. Led on by a vain belief that he had parts to conquer all difficulties, he had indulged without restraint a passion in which interest was seconded by inclination. Allured by such fascinating powers, he shortly suffered nothing to stop his course; and though when he began his career he would have started at the mention of actual dishonour, long before it was concluded, neither treachery nor perjury were regarded by him as stumbling blocks. All fear of failing was lost in vanity, all sense of probity was sunk in interest, all scruples of conscience were left behind by the heat of the chace. Yet the unforeseen and melancholy catastrophe of his long arts, illustrated in his despite what his principles had obscured,  that even in worldly pursuits where fraud out-runs integrity, failure joins dishonour to loss, and disappointment excites triumph instead of pity. The upright mind of Cecilia, her purity, her virtue, and the moderation of her wishes, gave to her in the warm affection of Lady Delvile, and the unremitting fondness of Mortimer, all the happiness human life seems capable of receiving: yet human it was, and as such imperfect! she knew that, at times, the whole family must murmur at her loss of fortune, and at times she murmured herself to be thus portionless, tho' an HEIRESS. Rationally, however, she surveyed the world at large, and finding that of the few who had any happiness, there were none without some misery, she checked the rising sigh of repining mortality, and, grateful with general felicity, bore partial evil with chearfullest resignation. 	15768000.0	0	[0, 2, 3, 1]	CALC ERROR	1: The passage describes the lingering misery of a man named Monckton, who had indulged in a passion without restraint and lost his sense of probity.

401	thevirginian.txt|0|u	ENTER THE MAN SOME notable sight was drawing the passengers, both men and women, to the window; and therefore I rose and crossed the car to see what it was. I saw near the track an enclosure, and round it some laughing men, and inside it some whirling dust, and amid the dust some horses, plunging, huddling, and dodging. They were cow ponies in a corral, and one of them would not be caught, no matter who threw the rope. We had plenty of time to watch this sport, for our train had stopped that the engine might take water at the tank before it pulled us up beside the station platform of Medicine Bow. We were also six hours late, and starving for entertainment. The pony in the corral was wise, and rapid of limb. Have you seen a skilful boxer watch his antagonist with a quiet, incessant eye ? Such an eye as this did the pony keep upon whatever man took the rope. The man might pretend to look at the weather, which was fine; or he might affect earnest conversation with a bystatider: it was bootless. The pony saw through it. No feint hoodwinked him.

Then the rope would sail out at him, but he was already elsewhere; and if horses laugh, gaiety must have abounded in that corral. Sometimes the pony took a turn alone; next he had slid in a flash among his brothers, and the whole of them like a school oj: playful fish whipped round the corral, kicking up the fine dust, and (I take it) roaring with laughter. Through the window glass of our Pullman the thud of their mischievous hoofs reached us, and the strong, humorous curses of the cow boys. Then for the first time I noticed a man who sat on the high gate of the corral, looking on. For he now climbed down with the undulations of a tiger, smooth and easy, as if his muscles flowed beneath his skin. The others had all visibly whirled the rope, some of them even shoulder high. I did not see his arm lift or move. He appeared to hold the rope down low, by his leg. But like a sudden snake I saw the noose go out its length and fall true; and the thing was done. As the captured pony walked in with a sweet, church door expression, our train moved slowly on to the station, and a passenger remarked, ' That man knows his business.' 	2.0	5	[0, 3, 1, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator watches cowboys in a corral catching a pony with a lasso.

' She runs around mighty irresponsible, and she'll stand a prairie dog 'bout as often as she'll stand a bird. She's a triflin' animal.' My anxiety to own the ducks caused me to pitch into the water with all my clothes on, and subsequently crawl out a slippery, triumphant, weltering heap. The Virginian's serious eyes had rested upon this spectacle of mud; but he expressed nothing, as usual. ' They ain't overly good eatin', ' he observed, tying the birds to his saddle. ' They'Re diverse.' ' Diverse! ' I exclaimed. ' Why didn't they dive?' ' I reckon they was young ones and hadn't experience.'  ' Well, ' I said, crestfallen, but attempting to be humorous, ' I did the diving myself.' But the Virginian made no comment. He handed me my double barrelled English gun, which I was about to leave deserted on the ground behind me, and we rode home in our usual silence, EM'LY 71 the mean little white breasted, sharp billed diverse dangling from his saddle. It was in the bunk house that he took his revenge. As I passed I heard his gentle voice silently achieving some narrative to an attentive audience, and just as I came by the open window where he sat on his bed in shirt and drawers, his back to me, I heard his concluding words, ' And the hat on his haid was the one mark showed yu' he weien't a snappin' turtle.' 	60.0	120	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator and the Virginian go duck hunting.

We had walked toward the corral, and he was now scrutinising Em'ly with interest. She was an egregious fowl. She was huge and gaunt, with great yellow beak, and she stood straight and alert in the manner of responsible people. There was something wrong with, her tail. It slanted far to one side, one feather in it twice as long as the rest. Feathers on her breast there were none. These had been worn entirely off by her habit of sitting upon potatoes and other rough abnormal objects. And this lent to her appearance an air of being decollete, singularly at variance with her otherwise prudish ensemble. Her eye was remarkably bright, but somehow it had an outraged expression. It was as if she went about the world perpetually scandalised over the doings that fell beneath her notice. Her legs were blue, long, and remarkably stout. ' She'D ought to wear knickerbockers, ' murmured the Virginian. ' She'D look a heap better'n some o' them college students. And she'll set on potatoes, yu' say ?

She was not sorry to have Georgie Taylor come galloping along at this moment and join them. But the Virginian swore profanely under his breath. And on this ride nothing more happened. XXIII VARIOUS POINTS LOVE had been snowbound for many weeks. Before this imprisonment its course had run neither smooth nor rough, so far as eye could see; it had run either not at all, or, as an undercurrent, deep out of sight. In their rides, in their talks, love had been dumb, as to spoken words at least; for the Virginian had set himself a heavy task of silence and of patience. Then, where winter barred his visits to Bear Creek, and there was for the while no ranch work or responsibility to fill his thoughts and blood with action, he set himself a task much lighter. Often, instead of Shakespeare and fiction, school books lay open on his cabin table; and penmanship and spelling helped the hours to pass. Many sheets of paper did he fill with various exercises, and Mrs. Henry gave him her assistance in advice and corrections. ' I shall presently be in love with him myself, ' she told the Judge.

' There's only one woman for him any more.' 	70560.0	20160	[0, 1, 2, 3]	VALID	1: The Virginian and his love interest have a conversation in which he tells her she's the best he's got. Georgie Taylor interrupts them, and nothing else happens on their ride. The passage then describes how love had been 'snowbound' for weeks, and how the Virginian has been studying penmanship and spelling with Mrs. Henry's help. 2: The passage describes a conversation and a ride, which would take at most a few hours. The reference to love being 'snowbound' for weeks suggests that more time has passed, but it's unclear how much. Let's say two weeks have passed since the last time love was mentioned.  3: Two weeks have elapsed. At 7 days a week that's 14 days. 24 hours in a day, so 336 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 20160 minutes. 4: 20160 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

Top, left, ' he repeated, and warily brought his glance to the place. ' Proved! ' he cried. ' It's all so ! ' He now noticed the miniature of Grandmother Stark. ' You are awful like her, ' he whispered. ' You'Re cert'nly awful like her. May I kiss you too, ma'am ?' Then, tottering, he rose from his sick chair. The Navajo blanket fell from his shoulders, and gradually, experimentally, he stood upright. Helping himself with his hand slowly along the wall of the room, and round to the opposite wall with many a pause, he reached the picture, and very gently touched the forehead of the ancestral dame with his lips. ' I promise to make your little girl happy, ' he whispered. 	2.0	5	[1, 0, 2, 3]	VALID	1: A man is checking to see if a book has a hole in it, and then notices a miniature of Grandmother Stark. He comments on the resemblance between the woman in the miniature and the person he is with, and asks if he can kiss her. He then stands up and touches the forehead of the woman in the miniature.  2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage. The man's actions are described in detail, but they are slow and halting. It's possible that the entire passage takes place over the course of a few minutes, but it could also take longer. Let's say five minutes.  3: Five minutes have elapsed.  4: 5 minutes.  5: High confidence.

But if Steve had played the coward, too, it would have been a whole heap easier for me.' He paused before adding, ' And Steve was not a miscreant once.' His voice had trembled, and I felt the deep emotion that seemed to gain upon him now that 394 THE VIRGINIAN action was over and he had nothing to do but think. And his view was simple enough: you must die brave. Failure is a sort of treason to the brotherhood, and forfeits pity. It was Steve's perfect bearing that had caught his heart so that he forgot even his scorn of the other man. But this was by no means all that was to come. He harked back to that notion of a prisoner helping to make it easy for his executioner. ' Easy plumb to the end, ' he pursued, his mind reviewing the acts of the morning. ' Why, he tried to give me your newspaper. I didn't — ' ' Oh, no, ' I said hastily. ' I had finished with it.' ' Well, he took dying as naturally as he took living. Like a man should. Like I hope to.' Again he looked at the pictures in his mind. ' No play acting nor last words. He just told goodbye to the boys as we led his horse under the limb — you needn't to look so dainty, ' he broke off. ' You ain't going to get any more shocking particulars.' 	2.0	45	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: A man reflects on the bravery of a recently executed prisoner, Steve, and his own view that one must die bravely. He recalls Steve's perfect bearing and how he took dying naturally.  2: The passage describes a man reflecting on events that have already happened, so it's difficult to say how much time has passed. The events themselves, the execution and the man's reflections, probably took less than an hour.  3: Let's say 45 minutes have elapsed.  4: 45 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

He drew off the glove from her left hand, and stooping, kissed the jewel in that other ring which he had given her. The crimson fire in the opal seemed to mingle with that in his heart, and his arm lifted her during a moment from the saddle as he held her to him. But in her heart the love of him was troubled by that cold pang of loneliness which had crept upon her like a tide as the day drew near. None of her own people were waiting in that distant town to see her become his bride. Friendly faces she might pass on the 444 WITH MALICE AFORETHOUGHT 445 way; but all of them new friends, made in this wild country: not a face of her childhood would smile upon her; and deep within her, a voice cried for the mother who was far away in Vermont.

He takes off her glove and kisses a ring on her finger. She feels lonely because none of her family will be there to see her get married. 2: The passage describes a moment of intense emotion, but it's hard to say how long it lasts.

When they came back to its margin for the second time, he bade her notice how its water had become at last wholly clear. To her it had seemed clear enough all along, even in the plain above the town. But now she saw that it flowed lustrously with flashes; and she knew the soil had changed to mountain soil. Lower down, the water had carried the slightest cloud of alkali, and this had dulled the keen edge of its transparence. Full solitude was around them now, so that their words grew scarce, and when they spoke it was with low voices. They began to pass nooks and AT DUNBARTON 487 points favourable for camping, with wood and water at hand, and pasture for the horses. More than once as they reached such places, she thought he must surely stop; but still he rode on in advance of her (for the trail was narrow) until, when she was not thinking of it, he drew rein and pointed. ' What ? ' she asked timidly. ' The pines, ' he answered. She looked, and saw the island, and the water folding it with ripples and with smooth spaces. The sun was throwing upon the pine boughs a light of deepening red gold, and the shadow of the fishing rock lay over a little bay of quiet water and sandy shore. In this forerunning glow of the sunset, the pasture spread like emerald; for the dry touch of summer had not yet come near it. 	120.0	240	[2, 1, 0, 3]	VALID	1: A man and a woman follow a stream that goes into deep canyons twice. When they return to the stream, the man points out that the water is now clear. They ride through a remote area with good camping spots and eventually stop to look at an island in the water, which is surrounded by a beautiful landscape. 2: The passage describes a journey through a remote area, with no explicit reference to time. The journey seems to take several hours, given the changes in the stream and the landscape. Let's say four hours. 3: Four hours have elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour, that's 240 minutes. 4: 240 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

Their first arrival, the one at Bennington, had been thus: Sam Bell had met them at the train, and Mrs. Wood, waiting in her parlour, had embraced her daughter and received her son-in-law. Among them they had managed to make the occasion as completely mournful as any family party can be, with the window blinds up. ' And with you present, my dear, ' said Sam Bell to Sarah, ' the absence of a coffin was not felt.' But at Dunbarton the affair went off differently. The heart of the ancient lady had taught her better things. From Bennington to Dunbarton is the good part of a day's journey, and they drove up to the gate in the afternoon. The great aunt was in her garden, picking some August flowers, and she called as the carriage stopped, ' Bring my nephew here, my dear, before you go into the house.' At this, Molly, stepping out of the carriage, squeezed her husband's hand. ' I knew that she would be lovely, ' she whispered to him. And then she ran to her aunt's arms, and let him follow. He came slowly, hat in hand. The old lady advanced to meet him, trembling a little, and holding out her hand to him. ' Welcome, nephew, ' she said. ' What a tall fellow you are, to be sure. Stand off, sir, and let me look at you.' 	2880.0	420	[1, 0, 3, 2]	VALID	1: A bride and groom visit the bride's great aunt at Dunbarton. The aunt greets the groom warmly. 2: The passage describes the couple's arrival at two different locations, but only the journey time between them is given. The journey takes 'the good part of a day,' which we can estimate as 6-8 hours.  3: Let's say 7 hours have elapsed. That's 420 minutes. 4: 420 minutes. 5: High confidence.

And so it happened that before she left this world, the great aunt was able to hold in her arms the first of their many children. Judge Henry at Sunk Creek had his wedding present ready. His growing affairs in Wyoming needed his presence in many places distant from his ranch, and he made the Virginian his partner. When the thieves prevailed at length, as they did, forcing cattle owners to leave the country or be ruined, the Virginian had forestalled this crash.	2628000.0	2628000	[1, 3, 2, 0]	VALID	1: The old lady gives comfort and advice to her niece and her niece's partner, and promises to have a nursery ready for their children. Later, the partner becomes Judge Henry's partner in Wyoming, and forestalls a crash caused by thieves. 2: There are no explicit references to time, but the passage covers a wedding, the birth of at least one child, and the Virginian becoming Judge Henry's partner. These events could take years.  3: Let's say five years have elapsed. At 365 days a year that's 1825 days. 24 hours in a day, so 43800 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 2628000 minutes. 4: 2628000 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because of the ambiguity of the passage.

Then, in 1892, came the cattle war, when, after putting their men in office, and coming to own some of the newspapers, the thieves brought ruin on themselves as well. For in a broken country there is nothing left to steal. But the railroad came, and built a branch to that land of the Virginian's where the coal was. By that time he was an important man, with a strong grip on many various enterprises, and able to give his wife all and more than she asked or desired. So THE VIRGINIAN Sometimes she missed the Bear Creek days, when she and he had ridden together, and sometimes she declared that his work would kill him. But it does not seem to have done so.

The cattle war of 1892 suggests that at least a few years have passed since the herds were driven away to Montana. The arrival of the railroad suggests that it's at least the 1890s. Let's say that the events described span five years. 3: Five years have elapsed. At 365 days a year that's 1825 days x 24 hours in a day, so 43800 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 2628000 minutes. 4: 2628000 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the estimate is based on speculation about the passage of time.
417	PowePA.txt|0|u	SIX MONTHS AGO A friend of mine and I left doctoral programs in chemistry under certain different circumstances. Tom, a true scientist, got a letter at Oak Ridge, where he was finishing up his degree, informing him he had a job for the taking in Alabama—a high-level, nuclear police-chaperon affair, to judge from what he gleefully told me. I, scientist by default, by process of elimination, got a letter from my girlfriend in Norway letting me know in the subtlest, happiest way imaginable that I would not be joining her there as we had planned upon completion of my degree. When you are told that your fiancée, a promising post-doc to an internationally famous crystallographer expatriated from Brooklyn, finds that sagacious mentor “a cute little guy (only five three!)” who “eats eggs on his hamburgers!”—you can read all the handwriting on the wall you ever need to read. I called her up, twice (once, as the rhyme puts it, for the money—$300; and once for the show—a considerable theater of her releasing, in a two-hour transatlantic tear burst, from the gunny sack of our entire six years off-and-on together, every crime of impassion I committed, and these transgressions I admit were endless, ranging from birthdays forgotten to old lovers not forgotten), and got a picture, as you can only on a telephone costing you a month's stipend, of her veritable sainthood for having put up for so long with the entire sham she convinced me I was, and was certain, as I reluctantly hung up the second time, that I had lost the finest, purest girl ever there would be for me. The starch in my doctorate will, which had not been much to begin with, vanished. 	10080.0	259200	[3, 0, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator describes how he and a friend left doctoral programs in chemistry six months ago. The friend got a job in Alabama, while the narrator's girlfriend broke up with him via letter from Norway. The narrator called her twice and got a long, tearful explanation of all his faults.  2: The passage describes events that happened six months ago.  3: Six months have elapsed.

Tom is the sort of natural scientist who can learn, say, Schrödinger, while penciling Walt Disney characters in the margins and filling their balloons with the integrals and derivatives required on the following day's examination, and the first thing I saw on the card was a Goofyesque figure clearly representing Tom holding a Geiger counter to the rear end of an armadillo. Around the card this same figure pursued armadillos in odd attitudes and circumstances.  With a magnifying glass—Tom can put, he claims, four thousand words on a postcard—I made out this:   Remember Elaine? (Good girl.) I married her. Sold tent. Sold Mustang. It was a good car. Goofytom is doing what he does. Did you know armadillo feces register most accurately low-level hot traces around reactors? Me neither. P.U. Have my own desk.

Tom announces that he has married Elaine, sold his tent and Mustang, and has his own desk. He also mentions a colleague whose badge and ID papers have been found. 2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the narrator says that he has been walking around the lab for two weeks. The events described in the postcard could have taken a few days to a few weeks. Let's say one week. 3: One week has elapsed. At seven days a week that's 7 days. 24 hours in a day, so 168 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 10080 minutes. 4: 10080 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

You couldn't tell how many times his odometer might already have been around. He was not quite a bright, careful boy.  There was finally a bit of powerful logic in this dead-fucking-nigger thing, too. The rooms—all of them—did smell like piss, and the smell did seem to strengthen when you were away, and the Veteran's puddle was perpetual, whereas my window, always open, never seemed to take in rain. And the Veteran had absolutely nothing in his room to steal except his cheap clock radio, which is the perfect inspiration for a petty thief to foul things. Standing there with him, I thought finally that his truest touch was in believing his tormentor dead: I half thought there might be something to it all whenever he said dead.  The only sense this makes is to see the scene and its effect on me as what we call an energy of activation in the long series of planless, purposeless goings-on that followed. I have been occupied since all the quitting began with people who are anything but custodians of their chances in life. 	0.4998	0	[1, 3, 0, 2]	CALC ERROR	1: The narrator reflects on the appearance of a man called the Veteran, and on the logic of a racist insult he has heard.

The narrator's thoughts seem to be rapid, but there is no way to estimate how long they take. 3: N/A 4: N/A 5: High confidence that no time is described.

You gals go out there and mow some friggin parrot jungle down and the kid 'n me makes a round.”  Hoop rushed toward the bar, a substantial rattan-and-hardwood thing I hadn't noticed, dusty in a corner of the patio. Virginia and Constance went out with a pair of shears.  “Would you look at the dust!” Hoop yelled. “Find me some swabbin gear, Chief.”  I went in the kitchen, made us two drinks, and returned with a rag and soap. “She's been making them in there.”  “I know, for Christ sake. Broad's got this bar from the islands, beautiful friggin teak here, won't use it. We take it apart and hide it on board and get it here and get it back together—that's the friggin miracle, and tight when we busted her up—no friggin numbers on it like your dinosaurs and shit.”  “Where was this?”  “Mutton fart capital of the world.”  “You were in the navy?”  “Guam, Guadalcanal, one of them G islands. No, Seabees. All them islands is alike. This bastard could've come from the halls of friggin Montezuma. What the shit difference. It's heavy, pure-quill teak, we stole it from an operating whorehouse, we got it here is the thing. Contrabandits! Joke!”  Hoop threw the rag and soap bottle at the bar's small chrome sink. “Whore called Five-ton sits on it, crying, see? Because Stump and me are having at it with screwdrivers, see?” He goes into falsetto. “ ‘I love you, Joes, no shit, Joes, but need post office for sell love.' Five-ton whines this at us, see? Imagine that: some wiseheimy tells 'em a friggin whorehouse is a post office and they buy it. ‘You want first class, Joe?' It was a scream. ‘You want special delivery?' There Five-ton is, trying to hold the bar down, crying, and Stump and me start pulling it apart. Beautiful.” He is wiping the bar with great, broad strokes. I already feel drunk again.

Hoop is furiously twisting a dish towel inside a glass.  “It's his past,” Mary says. She rolls her eyes. Virginia comes in with flowers, looking for a vase, her perfect teeth apologetically out front.  Hoop squeaks the rag in his glass and holds it to the light. “That's a clean glass,” he says. “Something about a really clean glass, eh, Chief?”  Virginia passes through the room again, still looking for a vase.  I had the feeling that time was lurching and braking and bouncing me around within it. Ray Conniff and His Singers, for one thing, were suddenly very much with us, and I seemed to be swaying along with Mary to them.  “Always use your twist on these,” Hoop said, grinding a lemon rind around a glass rim. “People never follow their friggin recipes.”  I jumped because of breath in my ear. “How's your clutch?” Mary said, inches from me.  “ 'Ere you go, Chief.” Hoop plunked three new drinks squarely on fresh cocktail napkins in front of us. “From the bar, where they ought to be,” he said proudly. Mary blew smoke at him and took a stool next to mine. She put a finger into the waistband of my putter pants. 	3.0	600	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator is at a bar with Mary and Hoop. Time seems to be passing in a disjointed way, with the narrator feeling like he's missed something. Hoop is cleaning glasses and giving advice on drink-making. Virginia comes in looking for a vase. Mary flirts with the narrator. 2: There are no explicit references to time, but the disjointedness of the narrator's experience suggests that time is passing in a non-linear way. Let's say the events described take place over 10 minutes. 3: 10 minutes have elapsed. 4: 600 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the estimate is based on inference rather than explicit information.

I couldn't tell if she was mocking.  “What do you call the bedspins?” I asked.  “The whirlies.” I had thought maybe she had an exotic name from her own generation. She reached over and felt my forehead then, as if to say she had not meant to sound sarcastic if she had. I lay there spinning, thinking: She maybe thinks I know things, and maybe knows I don't.      SO THAT IS HOW I find myself sitting at this wire-mesh table in the mornings, taking hangover notes, reflex motions of a would-have-been scientist. Since that first day three weeks ago we've not had anything so spectacular as the drop-in. Hoop and Virginia's visit established several data points:   1. Sam, or Stump, is presumably dead, and that is the extent of my privileged knowledge.  2. He may have had something to do with Florida, where it is, as if in obeisance to Hoop's outbursts, somehow tacitly assumed we may go, so long as it—the going—does not obtain an urgency. There is a sense in which we are packing our things psychologically, and when the moment is right, but not demanding or in any way special, we will take off and simply be there as unprepared and innocent as we were that night in the Car Wash. 	30240.0	5	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator and Mary have a conversation about the narrator's knowledge and Mary's tone. The narrator then reflects on the past three weeks, including a visit from Hoop and Virginia that established some information about Sam and Florida.  2: The conversation with Mary is brief and probably takes less than a minute. The reflection on the past three weeks is more difficult to estimate, but it seems to be a summary of events rather than a detailed account. Let's say it takes five minutes.  3: Five minutes have elapsed.  4: 5 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.

He held them there while he bent down to a Styrofoam cooler on the floor and got two beers, then looked up at us and got two more, and Mary said, “We brought our own, thanks.”  “I'd give my eyeteeth,” Hazel said, “if I could still drink hard stuff.”  “Doctor told her it 'ud kill her,” Bruce said. Hazel kissed him again.  The girls went into old times, which were privately hilarious, while Bruce and I watched each other drink. After about twenty minutes, old times had become current events, and they had nothing currently in common except the visit, so Bruce and I were acknowledged. Hazel turned to him with yet another smacky kiss misaligning their eyeglasses. These kisses seemed designed and sufficient to make up for centuries of neglect. She held her lips to his cheek while he held his glasses in place.  “Do you know what this rascal did on our first date?” Hazel suddenly said. “He takes me to this bar outside town and says we're going on to another one ten miles away, so I better go to the can.”  “Seven miles,” Bruce said. 	22.0	60	[2, 1, 3, 0]	VALID	1: A group of people are sitting and drinking beer. Hazel and Bruce kiss several times, and Hazel tells a story about their first date.  2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the passage describes the group drinking four beers and Hazel and Bruce kissing multiple times. This could take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours, but let's say it takes an hour.  3: 1 hour has elapsed. Multiplying by 60 minutes an hour that's 60 minutes. 4: 60 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

I toasted McCrae and the screech owls.  Mary got up, sailed over to us; Bobby Cherry stood up, I didn't. “Handsome,” she said, “you ready to go?”  “Yes, ma'am,” I said. I stood up and tucked in my shirt. If there's anything dorkier than a man wearing a yellow golf suit behind a filling station with a bunch of the boys in their jeans and pearl-button shirts, I suppose it's a man wearing a yellow golf suit with the Ban-Lon shirt tucked in and the pants drawn up high showing a lot of sock. This was Mary's method: she effected a little drama under the oak by charming the men and then leaving with the fruit she called handsome, and it was my job to look even more geeky to further tweak them. She had done something of the opposite with me in front of Hoop.  The car was still where Mary had slung it. She paid the man in the metal chair, fired up, and we were off in a cloud of rocks and pop tops. I picked up the playscript. 	6.0	0	[2, 0, 3, 1]	CALC ERROR	1: The narrator is at a bar with Tush-hog and Mary. Mary calls the narrator 'Handsome' and they leave together.  2: The passage describes the narrator getting up from his seat, tucking in his shirt, and leaving with Mary.

And it may be that the successful operators in this scattered mode are examples simply of lassitude and want of ambition. Still, I want to dignify the downward with another parameter: Are they capitalizing upon liabilities while the others are insisting on investing in assets only? Mary seems able to accept a loss with a victory; Friedeman surely paid for pausing in his career to ponder salvation and damnation; but my own old man preaches pure profit until blue in the face, and I have added to his congestion by simple indifference, which indifference registers for him as aggressive courting of another Depression. Perhaps it is indifference which the true fools lack. I cannot say. I will continue to record.      WE DID TOWNS. QUINCY, Panacea, Sopchoppy, Carrabelle, Blountstown—the best town names in the world. We even tried to take a tour of Chattahoochee, the largest state asylum. We'd try something like that and never think of something like Disney World. It became perfectly and agreeably clear that neither of us had any idea what to do. We watched folk who did have ideas. 	30240.0	7200	[0, 1, 2, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator muses on the difference between people who are laid-back and those who are ambitious, and wonders if the former group might be capitalizing on liabilities while the latter group only invests in assets. The narrator then describes visiting various small towns with a companion, and feeling unsure of what to do. 2: The narrator's musings are abstract and don't describe any specific events, so we can't estimate time from them. The description of visiting small towns is more concrete, but still doesn't give us much to go on. Let's say they spent a day in each town, which would include some driving time between them.  3: 5 days have elapsed. At 24 hours a day that's 120 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 7200 minutes. 4: 7200 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
426	PowePA.txt|81|u	 “Al, make a check for two thousand. To yourself.”  I am writing today, not in the Mercury, but beside a plywood stand selling key-lime pies. I have eaten two slices of pie to justify writing on a picnic table beside the pie stand, but am drawing suspicious looks all the same. The girl in the stand has a tape player. We have just heard Freddie Fender sing of “wasted days and wasted nights.” Now Diana Ross of “no mountain high enough.”  We had taken the motel room, showered, and I sat down near the door. Mary sat on the bed, her arms on her knees, leaning toward me like a father. “There's nothing personal in this,” she said.  “In what?”  “You can take the Merc or the two thousand.”  I looked at her, and the color TV, on a stand about eye level with me. I mulled this one over until I found myself playing with my lips and stopped.  “I understand,” I said. What was odd was that I believe I did understand. She was closing a very successful road show and meant for us, as actors, to move on. And she was clever enough to fold following a packed-house night rather than when the play was in trouble.  “What about Stump's wardrobe?” I said. 	30.0	25	[3, 2, 1, 0]	VALID	1: The narrator writes beside a pie stand, eats two slices of pie, and listens to music. The narrator and Mary have taken a motel room and discussed something that is not explicitly stated. The narrator asks about Stump's wardrobe. 2: There are no explicit references to time in the passage. The narrator eats two slices of pie, which might take 10-15 minutes, and listens to two songs, which might take 6-8 minutes. The conversation with Mary is the most significant event, but it's unclear how long it takes. Let's say it takes 10 minutes.  3: 20-30 minutes have elapsed. The midpoint is 25 minutes.  4: 25 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
427	PowePA.txt|96|u	 “Say whut?”  The bus has taken an unexpected stop—for a flat, being attended to now by a Montgomery Ward truck—in Panacea. I enter Eastside Beverage. A white man is saying to a black named Augusta (from his work-shirt embroidery), “He is a nice snake.” Augusta says, “Don't start on me that shit.” “I'll show you,” the proprietor says, heading for the back. Augusta gets off his stool, ready to run, full of mock fear and a little true fear.  The proprietor returns with a cigar box, opens it: a boxful of snapshots.  “Oh,” Augusta says. “All right.”  In a photo the white man holds a large diamond-back in one smooth loop between its head and tail. The mouth is open, slack. “We enjoyed each other,” the proprietor says. Augusta looks at him with quick, hard, mock disapproval and some real disapproval. Apparently the proprietor is seeking to have Augusta believe the snake was alive and his pet.  “That's a dead snake,” I say.  “Yeah, he died.”  “No, he's dead right there.”  The proprietor does some sizing up of me. I get two quarts of beer I do not want, to remain casual and fluid.  “That snake was dead before you ever got near it.”  Augusta studies the picture.  “These two quarts of beer are for Augusta, a man who knows bullshit.”  Augusta says, “That I do.” He looks at the proprietor in a way designed, however, to let him know he thinks I'm crazy. 	3.0	5	[0, 3, 1, 2]	VALID	1: The narrator is on a bus that has stopped for a flat tire. The narrator enters a store where a white man shows a black man a photo of himself holding a dead snake. The narrator points out that the snake is dead, and the proprietor tries to save face. 2: The events in the store seem to take only a few minutes, perhaps five at most. 3: Five minutes have elapsed. 4: 5 minutes. 5: High confidence.

The word.”  “Damn straight.”  “And you're that kind.”  “Damn straight.”  “Good.”  Bobby Cherry's getting concerned. “Why is it good?” he says.  “I want you to be the kind of guy you say you are.”  “You don't think I am?”  “Didn't say that.”  “I better get in my truck before I do something I regret.”  “Get in your truck.”  He does. Easy as that.  In a dime store in Milton, Florida, I tell the clerk, “I don't think I'm a Communist.”  She passes my items past her: a balsa glider in a flat pack, tube socks, a tin box of split shot.  “I know you're not a Communist,” she says. “I wish it would rain.”  “Yes, ma'am. I know you do. It's a shame we undid the Indians,” I say. “They had those rain dances. Marched about a million of them right by here on the way to Oklahoma, too.”  “Nope,” she says, sacking my airplane, socks, shot.  “No?”  “Trucked 'em. Wouldn't let 'em touch the ground.”  “Shame.”  “Pity.”  “We are bad.”  She looks at me. I am testing her now.  “We are bad,” I say again. “You have hundreds of rubber buffalo and Indians in here for sale.” Perhaps she will think I'm a Communist, after all. 	5.0	3	[2, 0, 1, 3]	VALID	1: The passage is a conversation between two people, one of whom is concerned about the importance of a word. The conversation ends with one of them leaving. The second half of the passage is a brief exchange between the narrator and a store clerk in a dime store in Milton, Florida. 2: The conversation between the two people is brief and doesn't give any indication of how much time has passed. The exchange with the store clerk is also brief, but it involves the narrator purchasing items, which would take a few minutes. Let's say three minutes. 3: Three minutes have elapsed. 4: 3 minutes. 5: High confidence.
429	PowePA.txt|121|u	 I walk the tennis court, cracking acorns on the deep green composition surface made nearly black by the shadows of the oaks. In the early morning, hours before my father takes my mother to the beauty parlor, but only a bit sooner than she begins to pester him to do so, two black men about fifty years old, whom my father without malice calls The Boys, will arrive to rake the yard. I wish The Boys would sweep the courts as well, sweep these acorns going off like firecrackers out here at three in the morning. I pop, I skid, I skate. I lose track of time, I think—perhaps out of drinking shape without Mary—because it is suddenly dawning and I see The Boys arrive and set up to rake, nearly invisible in their green uniforms in the fog, talking as low and gently as if they were fishing.  As a child I thought The Boys were a constant two men and only now realize that they change over rapidly, supplied by a lawn service with access to an apparently inexhaustible supply of quiet, early-rising blacks. To my father I believe they are a constant team—The Boys. 	30.0	30	[2, 0, 1, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator walks on a tennis court, cracking acorns. The Boys, two black men who work for the narrator's father, arrive to rake the yard. The narrator reflects on how he used to think The Boys were a constant team, but now realizes they change over rapidly. 2: The passage describes the narrator walking on the tennis court, but doesn't give any indication of how long he spends there. The arrival of The Boys is described as sudden, so it's possible that only a few minutes have passed. However, the narrator also reflects on his drinking and losing track of time, which suggests that more time may have passed than is explicitly described. Let's estimate that the narrator spends 30 minutes on the tennis court before The Boys arrive. 3: 30 minutes have elapsed. 4: 30 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
430	PowePA.txt|126|u	  Muhv—   Garden restored. Miss you more than like. Got sillymental in Fla. (about Stump—don't tell Hoop) and messed up. Give call. Tunkie Friedeman gave address. Says he knows you'll be back in the sun soon, ha ha. Said to tell you that. ? Drop by? Love—    Friedeman? What in the world was going on? Tunkie Friedeman? Conspiracy theory entered my mind. This was no damned Brownian powder-blown drift. I felt like Mia Farrow in Rosemary's Baby.  Then again, was it only that Mary and Friedeman knew each other and somehow discovered—did I tell Mary I worked for a Friedeman and she held her no-bio tongue? Yes. I told her I worked for a nut. She smiled. She knew him. But how did she know I'd come home? She didn't. Chanced it. A small endothermic bonding 238 bondings down the thousandfold series that was evolving me unto some end.  I recalled an early chemistry professor I had who seemed to have relied entirely upon his sense of smell in achieving his considerable academic station. On emeritus status, he was employed to interest freshmen in the magic of chemistry—almost the alchemy of chemistry—its colors, its aromatic delights, even its poetry. His chemistry was numberless, headache-free, earthy, approximate, elegant—a chemistry that seduced worried freshmen. You may call dicopper oxide, he'd say, cuprous oxide, and copper oxide, cupric. You may, as the English do, refer to al-you-minium. Bleach is sodium hypohalite. He'd waft a tube to his Old World nose, hold it to the light—glacial acetic acid (you may call it condensed vinegar), or another tube, product of a spuming reaction—sniff—why, it's old methyl ethyl ketone. What's that brown stuff in there? Some suspicious student would ask. That, the emeritus Nose Chemist would say, that is nothing, some trash. 	120960.0	5	[1, 3, 2, 0]	VALID	1: This passage is difficult to summarize, but it appears to be a series of thoughts and memories that the narrator is having, including a reference to a chemistry professor and a conspiracy theory involving a person named Friedeman. 2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage, but the narrator's thoughts seem to be moving quickly and covering a lot of ground. Let's estimate that the events described take place over the course of a few minutes. 3: Let's say 5 minutes have elapsed. 4: 5 minutes. 5: Low confidence, as the passage is difficult to interpret and there is no explicit reference to time.
431	PowePA.txt|142|u	 Minnie smoking on the parapet, the Pacifist sitting on the roof with his head not a foot from her lap, Earl becalmed into a swaying surveillance of his car, I shaped the gravel around the wine. We looked like a guerrilla camp.  And so what is it, the older-women thing, that put the Pacifist and me into our revolts? Discovery of discoveries, looking at Minnie as I am, it comes to me: they have adjusted anti-actualization quotients like the blacks have. Thus, Minnie doubly is the queen bee that she is in this universe of practiced loss.  Mary was like a ball glove handed to you in the seventh inning, used by someone else during the critical innings, and you get to play when the game is nearly won or lost with a trained glove that promises to be error-free. She was frayed, she was wrinkled, she had a cotton-candy softness, but all in all, she was a package of reticence and careless ease so correctly balanced I had never been so attracted to a person in my life.  “Sheeeeeit,” the Pacifist suddenly said, going into a fit again. Minnie grabbed his hair and shook it gently and let go; the Pacifist looked up, around, to see what the pressure had been. I was pouring her another wine and he did not know she had touched him. 	5.0	5	[0, 3, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator and three other people are gathered on a rooftop, with one person smoking and another sitting with his head near her lap. The narrator reflects on the attraction of older women and describes a woman named Mary in detail. The Pacifist has a fit and Minnie touches his hair. 2: There are no explicit references to time, but the actions described seem to take place over a short period, perhaps a few minutes. 3: Let's say five minutes have elapsed. 4: 5 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
432	PowePA.txt|143|u	 Things were, at this moment, clear and not clear to me. Overall, I had taken a little downside sabbatical that had shown me something I would find it best to know only as the Nose Chemist knew his ketones: with Havana Carlisle in the back of my mind, I could inherit a two million net deal with enough grace that I would not worry about acquiring a $400 River Road plate, not haze a yardman—not much more, finally, was certain. Havana kept appearing to me: instead of cigar-waving down the main street of his town in Missouri, he was waving his cigar across my crushed-shell trucking lot. He was telling the company: Let's raise our anti-actualization quotients to comfortable levels and go on about our business with these pipes.  The world seemed a place of improbable wild hope. I told my father I will run his business—my business—and all I see, all I can hold probable about that, is gathering these fools together and seeing how far we can go on two million dollars. Bonaparte washes trucks, whistling shrilly all the live-long day, and drives. Wallace dispatches trucks by heaving darts into the territory board. The Veteran watches the grounds at night. My bus driver takes a load of oil pipe, and another, here, and there, and never has to return. When I get ambitious, I'll have Tunkie Friedeman come down and formulate a revolutionary synthetic that will set the pace for the next generation of pipe.  And Mary. I resolve, in the morning, to drop by. One does not, when calling on Mary, need pause to buy flowers.	40320.0	10080	[0, 2, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The narrator reflects on his recent experiences and his future plans, including taking over his father's business and visiting a woman named Mary. He also describes the people who work for him and his plans for the business. 2: There are no explicit references to time in the passage, but the narrator reflects on his recent experiences and his future plans, which could span days, weeks, or months. Let's say the events described span a week. 3: One week has elapsed. At seven days a week that's 7 days x 24 hours in a day, so 168 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 10080 minutes. 4: 10080 minutes. 5: Low confidence, as the passage is vague about the time frame.
433	GrisJR.txt|0|u	  One   The face of Nicholas Easter was slightly hidden by a display rack filled with slim cordless phones, and he was looking not directly at the hidden camera but somewhere off to the left, perhaps at a customer, or perhaps at a counter where a group of kids hovered over the latest electronic games from Asia. Though taken from a distance of forty yards by a man dodging rather heavy mall foot traffic, the photo was clear and revealed a nice face, clean-shaven with strong features and boyish good looks. Easter was twenty-seven, they knew that for a fact. No eyeglasses. No nose ring or weird haircut. Nothing to indicate he was one of the usual computer nerds who worked in the store at five bucks an hour. His questionnaire said he'd been there for four months, said also that he was a part-time student, though no record of enrollment had been found at any college within three hundred miles. He was lying about this, they were certain.  He had to be lying. Their intelligence was too good. If the kid was a student, they'd know where, for how long, what field of study, how good were the grades, or how bad. They'd know. He was a clerk in a Computer Hut in a mall. Nothing more or less. Maybe he planned to enroll somewhere. Maybe he'd dropped out but still liked the notion of referring to himself as a part-time student. Maybe it made him feel better, gave him a sense of purpose, sounded good. 	15.0	2880	[0, 3, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The passage describes a photograph of a man named Nicholas Easter, who is working in a store and is suspected of lying about being a part-time student. 2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but it does describe the process of taking a photograph and conducting research on Easter. This process might take a few hours or days, but it's impossible to know for sure. Let's say two days. 3: Two days have elapsed. At 24 hours a day that's 48 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 2880 minutes. 4: 2880 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the passage doesn't provide much information about the passage of time.
434	GrisJR.txt|1|u	 But he was not, at this moment nor at any time in the recent past, a student of any sort. So, could he be trusted? This had been thrashed about the room twice already, each time they came to Easter's name on the master list and his face hit the screen. It was a harmless lie, they'd almost decided.  He didn't smoke. The store had a strict nonsmoking rule, but he'd been seen (not photographed) eating a taco in the Food Garden with a co-worker who smoked two cigarettes with her lemonade. Easter didn't seem to mind the smoke. At least he wasn't an antismoking zealot.  The face in the photo was lean and tanned and smiling slightly with lips closed. The white shirt under the red store jacket had a buttonless collar and a tasteful striped tie. He appeared neat, in shape, and the man who took the photo actually spoke with Nicholas as he pretended to shop for an obsolete gadget; said he was articulate, helpful, knowledgeable, a nice young man. His name badge labeled Easter as a Co-Manager, but two others with the same title were spotted in the store at the same time. 	15.0	3	[3, 2, 1, 0]	VALID	1: A group of people are discussing whether to trust someone named Easter. They look at a photo of him and discuss his smoking habits and job title. 2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the passage describes a conversation that seems to take place over a few minutes.  3: Let's say three minutes have elapsed.  4: 3 minutes. 5: High confidence.
435	GrisJR.txt|7|u	 Carl ran through the photos of the Wilkeses' home, a massive suburban trilevel with Doctor stamped all over it. He spent little time with these, saving the best for last. Then there was Traci, once again soaked with sweat, her designer bike nearby on the grass, sitting under a tree in a park, far away from everyone, half-hidden and—smoking a cigarette!  The same photographer grinned stupidly. It was his finest work, this hundred-yard shot of the doctor's wife sneaking a cigarette. He had had no idea she smoked, just happened to be nonchalantly smoking himself near a footbridge when she dashed by. He loitered about the park for half an hour until he saw her stop and reach into the pouch on her bike.  The mood around the room lightened for a fleeting moment as they looked at Traci by the tree. Then Carl said, “Safe to say that we'll take number fifty-seven.” He made a notation on a sheet of paper, then took a sip of old coffee from a paper cup. Of course he'd take Traci Wilkes! Who wouldn't want a doctor's wife on the jury when the plaintiff's lawyers were asking for millions? Carl wanted nothing but doctors' wives, but he wouldn't get them. The fact that she enjoyed cigarettes was simply a small bonus. 	5.0	40	[3, 1, 0, 2]	VALID	1: A group of people are looking at photos of potential jurors. They come across a photo of Traci Wilkes smoking a cigarette in a park. They decide to select her for the jury. 2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time. However, the photographer had to wait around for half an hour to get the shot of Traci smoking, so we can assume that at least that much time has passed. Let's say the group spends another 10 minutes looking at the photos and discussing them.  3: 40 minutes have elapsed. 4: 40 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
436	GrisJR.txt|48|u	 “You were on a civil jury a few years back, I believe,” Rohr said warmly.  “Yes,” she said, clearing her throat and trying to be loud.  “What kind of case was it?” he asked, though he knew virtually every detail—seven years ago, this very courtroom, different judge, zero for the plaintiff. The file had been copied weeks ago. Rohr had even talked to the plaintiff's lawyer, a friend of his. He started with this question and this juror because it was an easy warm-up, a soft pitch to show the others how painless it was to raise one's hand and discuss matters.  “A car wreck case,” she said.  “Where was the trial?” he asked sincerely.  “Right here.”  “Oh, in this courtroom.” He sounded quite surprised, but the defense lawyers knew he was faking.  “Did the jury reach a verdict in that case?”  “Yes.”  “And what was that verdict?”  “We didn't give him anything.”  “Him being the plaintiff?”  “Yes. We didn't think he was really hurt.”  “I see. Was this jury service a pleasant experience for you?”  She thought a moment, then, “It was okay. Lot of wasted time, though, you know, when the lawyers were wrangling about this or that.”  A big smile. “Yes, we tend to do that. Nothing about that case would influence your ability to hear this one?”  “No, don't think so.”  “Thank you, Mrs. Millwood.” Her husband was once an accountant for a small county hospital that was forced to close after being nailed in a medical malpractice case. Large verdicts were something she secretly loathed, and for good reason. Jonathan Kotlack, the plaintiff's lawyer in charge of final jury selection, had long since removed her name from consideration. 	2.0	120	[2, 0, 1, 3]	VALID	1: A lawyer is questioning a potential juror about her past experience on a civil jury. The lawyer already knows the details of the case and is using the questioning as a warm-up for the other jurors. The juror's husband was an accountant for a hospital that was sued in a medical malpractice case. 2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time. The questioning seems to be happening in real-time, so let's say two minutes have elapsed. 3: Two minutes have elapsed. Multiplying by 60 minutes in an hour, that's 120 minutes. 4: 120 minutes. 5: High confidence.
437	GrisJR.txt|103|u	 Jerry Fernandez had already nicknamed him Napoleon. Nap for short. The Retarded Colonel as an alternative.  “There were no complaints yesterday,” Nicholas shot back.  “Let's eat. I'm starving,” Herrera said, unwrapping a sandwich. A few of the others did the same.  The aroma of baked chicken and french fries rose from the table. As Mr. O'Reilly finished unpacking a container of pasta salad, he said, “I'll be happy to bring over some plates and forks on Monday. No problem.”  Nicholas quietly said, “Thanks,” and sat down.   THE DEAL was an easy one to make. The details were wrapped up between two old friends over a three-hour lunch at the ‘21' Club on Fifty-second. Luther Vandemeer, CEO of Trellco, and his former protégé, Larry Zell, now CEO of Listing Foods, had discussed the basics on the phone, but needed to meet face-to-face over food and wine so no one could hear them. Vandemeer gave him the background of the latest serious threat down in Biloxi, and didn't hide the truth that he was worried. Sure, Trellco was not a named defendant, but the entire industry was under fire and the Big Four was standing firm. Zell knew this. He'd worked for Trellco for seventeen years, and had learned to hate trial lawyers a long time ago. 	180.0	1318320	[3, 1, 2, 0]	VALID	1: A group of people are eating baked chicken and french fries. Mr. O'Reilly offers to bring plates and forks on Monday. Two CEOs have lunch and discuss a threat to their industry.  2: There is no explicit reference to time in the first paragraph. The second paragraph mentions a three-hour lunch, but it is unclear when this occurred. The third paragraph references a seventeen-year career, but again it is unclear when this began. We can guess that the lunch took place within the last week, and that the career began at least 20 years ago.  3: Let's say the lunch took place three days ago, and the career began 25 years ago. That's 3 days x 24 hours in a day x 60 minutes in an hour = 4320 minutes for the lunch, and 25 years x 365 days in a year x 24 hours in a day x 60 minutes in an hour = 1314000 minutes for the career.  4: 1318320 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because of the amount of speculation required.
438	GrisJR.txt|142|u	 Nicholas took a seat at the table and began discussing strategy with Herman. It was not fair to keep them locked up during delays such as this, and Nicholas was of the opinion that they should be allowed to leave the building, with escorts, and engage in morning walks, as opposed to those of the noontime variety. It was agreed that Nicholas should put this request in writing, as usual, and present it to Judge Harkin during the noon recess.   AT TEN-THIRTY, they finally walked into the courtroom, the air still heavy with the heat of battle, and the first person Nicholas saw was the man who'd broken into his apartment. He was out there on the third row, plaintiff's side, in a shirt and tie with a newspaper spread before him and resting on the back of the pew in front. He was alone, and he barely looked at the jurors as they took their seats. Nicholas didn't stare; two long glances and the identification was complete.  For all of his guile and cunning, Fitch could do some stupid things. And sending this goon into the courtroom was a risky move with little potential benefit. What was he supposed to see or hear that would not be seen or heard by one of the dozen lawyers, or half-dozen jury consultants, or handful of other flunkies Fitch kept in the courtroom? 	60.0	15	[0, 2, 1, 3]	VALID	1: Nicholas discusses strategy with Herman, then goes to court and sees a man who broke into his apartment. He identifies the man and thinks about the riskiness of the man's presence in the courtroom.  2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the passage describes a few actions that might take a few minutes each: discussing strategy, walking into the courtroom, and identifying the man. Let's say five minutes for each action.  3: 15 minutes have elapsed.  4: 15 minutes.  5: High confidence.
439	GrisJR.txt|191|u	 “Now, I have two choices. I can declare a mistrial, or I can sequester the jury. I'm inclined to pursue the latter, as distasteful as it will be. Mr. Rohr?”  Rohr was slow to rise, and for a rare moment could think of little to say. “Uh, gee, Judge, we'd sure hate to see a mistrial. I mean, I'm certain that we've done nothing wrong.” He glanced at the defense table as he said this. “Someone broke in on a juror?” he asked.  “That's what I said. I'll show you the proof in a moment. Mr. Cable?”  Sir Durr stood and buttoned his jacket right properly. “This is quite shocking, Your Honor.”  “Certainly is.”  “I'm really in no position to respond until I hear more,” he said, returning the look of utter suspicion to the lawyers who were obviously guilty, the plaintiff's.  “Very well. Bring in juror number four, Stella Hulic,” His Honor instructed Willis. Stella was stiff with fear and already pale by the time she reentered the courtroom.  “Please take a seat in the witness stand, Mrs. Hulic. This won't take but a minute.” The Judge smiled with great assurance and waved at the chair in the witness box. Stella shot wild looks in all directions as she sat down. 	1.6	1440	[0, 2, 1, 3]	VALID	1: A judge announces that someone broke in on a juror and offers to sequester the jury. The lawyers respond with varying degrees of concern. The judge then calls in the juror who was broken in on.  2: The events described in the passage take place in a courtroom and seem to unfold rapidly. The judge's offer to sequester the jury suggests that the trial is still ongoing, so let's say this all takes place in the course of a single day.  3: One day has elapsed. At 24 hours in a day that's 1440 minutes. 4: 1440 minutes. 5: High confidence.
440	GrisJR.txt|210|u	 Harkin made the mistake of glancing over his shoulder at Rohr, who couldn't wait to add a few thoughts. “Oh hell, Judge, what's the big deal?” he blurted. “These folks aren't carrying plastic explosives.”  “That's enough,” Harkin said, but Rohr had managed to curry a slight favor with the jury. Cable, of course, felt the same, and wanted to convey his heartfelt trust in whatever the jurors had packed in their American Touristers, but Harkin didn't give him the chance.  “Very well,” His Honor said. “The bags will not be searched. But if it comes to my attention that any juror possesses any item prohibited by the list I handed out yesterday, then that juror will be in contempt of court and subject to being jailed. Do we understand?”  Easter looked around the room, took the measure of each of his fellow jurors, most of whom appeared relieved and a few of whom were actually nodding. “That's fine, Judge,” he said.  “Good. Now can we get on with the trial?”  “Well, there's one other problem.”  “What is it?”  Nicholas lifted a sheet of paper from the table, read something, then said, “According to your rules here, we're allowed one conjugal visit per week. We think we should get more.”  “How many?”  “As many as possible.”  This was news to most of the jurors. There had been some grumbling among some of the men, Easter and Fernandez and Lonnie Shaver in particular, about the number of conjugal visits, but the women had not discussed it.	2.0	0	[1, 0, 2, 3]	CALC ERROR	1: A judge is presiding over a trial and has just made a ruling about whether jurors' bags will be searched. One of the jurors then raises the issue of conjugal visits.  2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage. The events described take place in a courtroom, which might suggest that they all happen in a single day. However, the passage does not provide enough information to make a confident estimate of time.  3: N/A 4: N/A 5: High uncertainty.

He'll name his price. If it's within our range, then you tell him it's a deal. We'll take care of the delivery, and you never know for certain if the cash actually changes hands. You've done nothing wrong. He's happy. We're happy because we're about to make a pot full of money, along with you, I might add.”  Hoppy liked it! None of the mud could stick to his hands. Let his client and Jimmy Hull do their dirty work. He'd stay out of the gutter and simply turn his head. Still, he was overcome by caution. He said he'd like to think about it.  They chatted some more, looked at the plans once again, and said good-bye at eight. Ringwald was to call early Friday morning.  Before heading home, Hoppy dialed the number on Ringwald's business card. An efficient receptionist in Las Vegas said, “Good afternoon, KLX Property Group.” Hoppy smiled, then asked to speak to Todd Ringwald. The call was routed, with soft rock in the background, to Mr. Ringwald's office where Hoppy spoke to Madeline, an assistant of some variety who explained that Mr. Ringwald was out of town and not expected back until Monday. She asked who was calling, and Hoppy quickly hung up. 	30.0	120	[2, 3, 0, 1]	VALID	1: Two men discuss a plan to make money by having the protagonist, Hoppy, meet with someone named Mr. Moke and negotiate a deal. Hoppy is cautious and says he needs to think about it. He calls Ringwald's office but hangs up when asked for his name. 2: There are no explicit references to time in the passage. The events described, including a conversation, looking at plans, and a phone call, might take an hour or two.  3: Let's say two hours have elapsed. That's 120 minutes. 4: 120 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
442	GrisJR.txt|288|u	 “You. He knows you're loose on the streets scheming up all sorts of ways to get to the jury. Wouldn't you be worried, Fitch, if some guy like you was hard at work for the plaintiff?”  “I'd be terrified.”  “Rohr isn't terrified. He's just worried.”  “How often do you talk to him?”  “A lot. He's sweeter than you, Fitch. He's a very pleasant man to talk to, plus he doesn't record my calls, doesn't send in goons to follow my car. None of that sort of stuff.”  “Really knows how to charm a girl, huh?”  “Yeah. But he's weak where it counts.”  “Where's that?”  “In the wallet. He can't match your resources.”  “How much of my resources do you want?”  “Later, Fitch. Gotta run. There's a suspicious-looking car sitting across the street. Must be some of your clowns.” She hung up.  Fitch showered and tried to sleep. At 2 A.M., he drove himself to the Lucy Luck, where he played blackjack at five hundred dollars a hand, sipped Sprite until dawn, when he left with close to twenty thousand dollars in fresh winnings.      Twenty   The first Saturday in November arrived with temperatures in the low sixties, unseasonably cool for the Coast and its near-tropical climate. A gentle breeze from the north rattled trees and scattered leaves on the streets and sidewalks. Fall usually arrived late and lasted until the first of the year, when it yielded to spring. The Coast did not experience winter. 	300.0	600	[1, 0, 2, 3]	VALID	1: The passage describes a conversation between two people, followed by one of them showering and trying to sleep, then going to a casino and winning money. The second paragraph describes the weather on the first Saturday in November. 2: The conversation and showering might take an hour or two, and the gambling might take several hours. The weather is described as being on a specific day, so we can assume that the events of the passage take place over the course of one day.  3: Let's say the events of the passage take place over the course of 10 hours.  4: 600 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
443	GrisJR.txt|376|u	 Derrick rolled over and fell fast asleep.  They awoke at dawn, and Angel panicked because she had a man in her room and this was, of course, against the Judge's orders. Derrick was unconcerned. He said he'd simply wait until they left for court, then sneak out of the room. This did little to calm her nerves. Angel took a long shower.  Derrick had taken Cleve's plan and improved on it immensely. After leaving the tavern, he bought a six-pack and drove along the Gulf for hours. Slowly, up and down Highway 90, past the hotels and casinos and boat docks, from Pass Christian to Pascagoula he had driven, sipping beer and expanding the scheme. Cleve, after a few drinks, had let it slip that the lawyers for the plaintiff were seeking millions. It took only nine of the twelve for a verdict, so Derrick figured Angel's vote was worth a helluva lot more than ten thousand dollars.  Ten thousand sounded great at the tavern, but if they would pay that much, and agree to do it so quickly, then they would pay more with pressure. The more he drove, the more her vote was worth. It was now at fifty, and rising almost by the hour. 	600.0	130	[2, 1, 3, 0]	VALID	1: Derrick and Angel wake up at dawn, and Angel is worried because Derrick is in her room against the Judge's orders. Derrick is unconcerned and plans to sneak out later. Angel takes a long shower. Derrick drives along the Gulf for hours, drinking beer and expanding on a scheme to get Angel to vote a certain way in a trial.  2: Angel takes a long shower, which could be anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes. Derrick drives along the Gulf for hours, but we don't know how many hours. Let's say he drove for four hours.  3: Angel's shower probably took around 20 minutes. Derrick's drive took four hours, or 240 minutes. The midpoint of the range is 130 minutes.  4: 130 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
444	GrisJR.txt|391|u	 But just one to settle his nerves, to help forget this miserable day.  “You okay, boss?” José asked.  Fitch grunted something, and stopped thinking about beer. Where was Marlee, and why hadn't she called today? The trial was winding down. A deal would take time to negotiate and execute.  He thought of the column in Mogul, and he longed for Marlee. He heard Jankle's idiotic voice expounding a brand-new defense theory, and he longed for Marlee. He closed his eyes and saw the faces of the jurors, and he longed for Marlee.   SINCE DERRICK now considered himself to be a major player, he chose a new meeting place for Wednesday night. It was a rough bar in the black section of Biloxi, a place Cleve had actually been before. Derrick figured he'd have the upper hand if the rendezvous occurred on his turf. Cleve insisted they meet in the parking lot first.  The lot was almost filled. Cleve was late. Derrick spotted him when he parked, and walked to the driver's side.  “I don't think this is a good idea,” Cleve said, peeking through the crack in his window and looking at the dark, cinder-block building with steel rods across the windows. 	1440.0	505	[0, 3, 1, 2]	VALID	1: The passage describes two different scenes. In the first, Fitch is thinking about Marlee and the trial. In the second, Derrick and Cleve are meeting in a parking lot before going to a bar. 2: There are no explicit references to time in the passage. However, the fact that the trial is winding down suggests that at least several weeks have passed since it began. The meeting between Derrick and Cleve is set for Wednesday night, so we can assume it is currently Wednesday.  3: Let's say three weeks have passed since the trial began. That's 21 days x 24 hours in a day, so 504 hours. Adding in the time for the meeting between Derrick and Cleve, let's say another hour has passed.  4: 505 hours. 5: Low confidence, as there is a lot of speculation involved in estimating the time passed.
445	GrisJR.txt|522|u	 Short of burning the courthouse or tossing grenades at the jury room, there was nothing he could do to stop the deliberations. They were in there, the last twelve, with deputies by the door. Perhaps if their work was slow, and if they had to retire for another night in sequestration, then perhaps Fitch could pull a rabbit from his hat and spark a mistrial.  A bomb threat was a possibility. The jurors would be evacuated, sequestered some more, led away to some hidden place so they could continue.  The flow chart fizzled and he made lists of possibilities—outrageous acts, all of which would be dangerous, illegal, and destined for failure.  The clock was ticking.  The chosen twelve—eleven disciples and their master.  He slowly rose to his feet and took the cheap ceramic lamp with both hands. It was a lamp Konrad had earlier wanted to remove because it sat on Fitch's desk, a place of great chaos and violence.  Konrad and Pang were loitering in the hallway, waiting for instructions. They knew something had gone terribly wrong. The lamp crashed with great force against the door. Fitch screamed. The plywood walls rattled. Another object hit and splintered; maybe it was a telephone. Fitch yelled something about “the money!” and then the desk landed loudly against a wall.  They backed away, petrified and not wanting to be near the door when it opened. Bam! Bam! Bam! It sounded like a jackhammer. Fitch was punching the plywood with his fists. 	60.0	3	[1, 2, 0, 3]	VALID	1: A man named Fitch is frustrated that he can't stop the jury from deliberating. He considers various illegal and dangerous options, then throws objects at the door and punches the walls in frustration.  2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the passage describes a series of actions that would take at least a few minutes. Let's say three minutes.  3: Three minutes have elapsed.  4: 3 minutes.  5: High confidence.
446	GrisJR.txt|539|u	 There was a long pause; the only sound came from Lonnie snipping his fingernails.  Finally, Nicholas said, “Who cannot vote to return any damages whatsoever?”  Savelle raised his hand. Lonnie ignored the question, but then he didn't need to respond.  “The vote stands at ten to two,” Nicholas reported, and wrote this down. “This jury has hereby reached its decision on liability. Now, let's settle the issue of damages. Can the ten of us agree that the Wood estate is entitled to the two million in actual damages?  Savelle kicked his chair back and left the room. Lonnie poured a cup of coffee and sat by the window, his back to the group, but listening to every word.  The two million sounded like pocket change in light of the previous discussion, and it was approved by the ten. Nicholas wrote this on a form approved by Judge Harkin.  “Can the ten of us agree that punitive damages should be imposed, in some amount?” He slowly went around the table and got a “Yes” from each. Mrs. Gladys Card hesitated. She could change her mind, but it would have no impact. Only nine votes were needed for a verdict.  “All right. Now, as to the amount of punitive damages. Any ideas?”  “I have one,” Jerry said. “Get everybody to write their amount on a piece of paper, fold it, keep it secret, then add them up and divide by ten. That way we'll see what the average is.”  “Will it be binding?” Nicholas asked. 	12.0	60	[3, 1, 0, 2]	VALID	1: A jury deliberates on a case, first deciding on liability and then on damages. They agree on two million in actual damages and then discuss punitive damages. One juror suggests a method for deciding on the amount of punitive damages. 2: The deliberations are described in detail, but there is no explicit reference to time. The events described could have taken anywhere from a few minutes to several hours. Let's say the deliberations took an hour. 3: One hour has elapsed. That's 60 minutes. 4: 60 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the passage doesn't give any clear indication of how much time has passed.

I lied and I cheated because that's what your client understands. Tell me, Fitch, did you find Gabrielle?”  “Yes, we did.”  “And did you find her parents?”  “We know where they are.”  “Do you understand now, Fitch?”  “It makes more sense, yes.”  “They were both wonderful people. They were intelligent and vigorous and they loved life. They both got hooked on cigarettes when they were in college, and I watched them fight the habit until they died. They hated themselves for smoking, but could never give it up. They died horrible deaths, Fitch. I watched them suffer and shrivel and gasp for breath until they couldn't breathe anymore. I was their only child, Fitch. Did your goons learn this?”  “Yes.”  “My mother died at home, on the sofa in the den because she couldn't walk to her bedroom. Just Mother and I.” She paused and glanced around. Fitch noticed her eyes were remarkably clear. Sad as it must have been, he could muster no sympathy.  “When did you set this plan in motion?” he asked, finally taking a spoonful of soup. 	2.0	2.5	[0, 2, 1, 3]	VALID	1: A conversation takes place between two people, one of whom has lied and cheated but claims not to be a thief. The other person is named Fitch. The first person tells Fitch about her parents' deaths from smoking and asks if Fitch's associates learned this information. Fitch asks when the first person set a plan in motion.  2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage. The conversation seems to take place in real time, so let's say two to three minutes.  3: Two and a half minutes have elapsed.  4: 2.5 minutes.  5: High confidence.

The idea evolved.”  “A helluva plot.”  “Thanks, Fitch. Coming from you, that's a compliment.”  She pulled her gloves tighter as if she was ready to go. “Just wanted to say hello, Fitch. And to make sure you know why it happened.”  “Are you finished with us?”  “No. We'll watch the appeal closely, and if your lawyers get too carried away attacking the verdict, then I've got copies of the wire transfers. Be careful, Fitch. We're kind of proud of that verdict, and we're always watching.”  She stood at the edge of the table. “And remember, Fitch, next time you boys go to trial, we'll be there.”    	1.1	5	[0, 1, 3, 2]	VALID	1: A woman and a man named Fitch discuss the woman's involvement in a legal case. She explains how she came to be involved and warns Fitch to be careful in the future.  2: There are no explicit references to time. The conversation seems to be brief, so let's say it takes five minutes.  3: 5 minutes have elapsed. 4: 5 minutes. 5: High confidence.
449	AuelJM.txt|0|u	1   Trembling with fear, Ayla clung to the tall man beside her as she watched the strangers approach. Jondalar put his arm around her protectively, but she still shook.  He's so big! Ayla thought, gaping at the man in the lead, the one with hair and beard the color of fire. She had never seen anyone so big. He even made Jondalar seem small, though the man who held her towered over most men. The red-haired man coming toward them was more than tall; he was huge, a bear of a man. His neck bulged, his chest could have filled out two ordinary men, his massive biceps matched most men's thighs.  Ayla glanced at Jondalar and saw no fear in his face, but his smile was guarded. They were strangers, and in his long travels he had learned to be wary of strangers.  “I don't recall seeing you before,” the big man said without preamble. “What Camp are you from?” He did not speak Jondalar's language, Ayla noticed, but one of the others he had been teaching her.  “No Camp,” Jondalar said. “We are not Mamutoi.” He unclasped Ayla and took a step forward, holding out both hands, palms upward showing he was hiding nothing, in the greeting of friendliness. “I am Jondalar of the Zelandonii.”  The hands were not accepted. “Zelandonii? That's a strange … Wait, weren't there two foreign men staying with those river people that live to the west? It seems to me the name I heard was something like that.”  “Yes, my brother and I lived with them,” Jondalar conceded. 	4.0	0	[2, 1, 3, 0]	CALC ERROR	1: Ayla and Jondalar encounter a group of strangers, including a very large man with red hair. The strangers ask where they are from and Jondalar explains that they are not from the Mamutoi, but from the Zelandonii. The strangers recognize the name from having met Jondalar's brother. 2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage. The events described take place in a matter of minutes.  3: N/A 4: N/A 5: High confidence.
450	AuelJM.txt|1|u	 The man with the flaming beard looked thoughtful for a while, then, unexpectedly, he lunged for Jondalar and grabbed the tall blond man in a bone-crunching bear hug.  “Then we are related!” he boomed, a broad smile warming his face. “Tholie is the daughter of my cousin!”  Jondalar's smile returned, a little shaken. “Tholie! A Mamutoi woman named Tholie was my brother's cross-mate! She taught me your language.”  “Of course! I told you. We are related.” He grasped the hands that Jondalar had extended in friendship, which he had rejected before. “I am Talut, headman of the Lion Camp.”  Everyone was smiling, Ayla noticed. Talut beamed a grin at her, then eyed her appreciatively. “I see you are not traveling with a brother now,” he said to Jondalar.  Jondalar put his arm around her again, and she noticed a fleeting look of pain wrinkle his brow before he spoke. “This is Ayla.”  “It's an unusual name. Is she of the river people?”  Jondalar was taken aback by the abruptness of his questioning, then, remembering Tholie, he smiled inwardly. The short, stocky woman he knew bore little resemblance to the great hulk of a man standing there on the riverbank, but they were chipped from the same flint. They both had the same direct approach, the same unself-conscious—almost ingenuous—candor. He didn't know what to say. Ayla was not going to be easy to explain. 	1.0	20160	[1, 0, 3, 2]	VALID	1: Jondalar meets Talut, who recognizes Jondalar's connection to his cousin's daughter Tholie. Talut is the headman of the Lion Camp. Talut asks about Ayla, and Jondalar is unsure how to explain her. 2: The events described take only a few minutes, but there are references to past events that could have taken weeks or months. Let's say two weeks. 3: Two weeks have elapsed. At 7 days a week that's 14 days. 24 hours in a day, so 336 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 20160 minutes. 4: 20160 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
451	AuelJM.txt|69|u	 “When she agreed to join with me, I decided to stay there with her I always had an interest in working stone, even as a youngster, and I learned their way of making spear points. They chip off both sides of the stone, you understand?” He directed the question to Jondalar.  “Yes, bifacially, like an axe.”  “But these points were not so thick and crude. They had good technique. I showed them some things, too, and I was quite content to accept their ways, especially after the Mother blessed her with a child, a boy. She asked me for a name, as was their custom. I chose Ranec.”  That explains it, Ayla thought. His mother was dark-skinned.  “What made you decide to come back?” Jondalar asked.  “A few years after Ranec was born, difficulties began. The dark-skinned people I was living with had moved there from farther south, and some people from neighboring Camps didn't want to share hunting grounds. There were differences in customs. I almost convinced them to meet and talk about it. Then some young hotheads from both sides decided to fight about it instead. One death led to another for revenge, and then to attacks on home Camps. 	2.0	2628000	[1, 3, 2, 0]	VALID	1: A man is explaining to Jondalar why he stayed with a group of people and learned to make spear points. He had a child with a woman there and named him Ranec. After a few years, conflict broke out between the group he was living with and neighboring groups, leading to violence. 2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the man mentions that he had a child a few years after he started living with the group. It's unclear how long he lived with them before having the child, but let's say it was at least a year. The conflict that broke out also seems to have taken some time to escalate. Let's say a few years passed before the violence began.  3: Let's say five years have elapsed. At 365 days a year that's 1825 days. 24 hours in a day, so 43800 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 2628000 minutes. 4: 2628000 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because of the amount of speculation required.
452	AuelJM.txt|81|u	 Ayla was in a turmoil, conflicting emotions pulling at her. These were the Others she had looked for. The kind she had been born to. She would have grown up with people like them, comfortable, at home, if it hadn't been for the earthquake. Instead she had been raised by the Clan. She knew Clan customs, but the ways of her own people were strange. Yet if it hadn't been for the Clan, she wouldn't have grown up at all. She couldn't go back to them, but she didn't feel that she belonged here, either.  These people were so noisy, and disorderly. Iza would have said they had no manners. Like that Frebec man, speaking out of turn, without asking permission, and then everyone yelling and talking at once. She thought Talut was a leader, but even he had to shout to make himself heard. Brun would never have had to shout. The only time she ever heard him shout was to warn someone of impending danger. Everyone in the clan kept the leader at a certain level of awareness; Brun had only to signal, and within heartbeats, he would have had everyone's attention.  She didn't like the way these people talked about the Clan, either, calling them flatheads and animals. Couldn't anyone see they were people, too? A little different, maybe, but people just the same. Nezzie knew it. In spite of what the rest said, she knew Rydag's mother was a woman, and the child to whom she gave birth only a baby. He's mixed, though, like my son, Ayla thought, and like Oda's little girl at the Clan Gathering. How could Rydag's mother have had a child of mixed spirits like that? 	5.0	10	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: Ayla is experiencing conflicting emotions about being among the Others, who are more like the people she was born to, but who also seem noisy and disorderly. She reflects on the differences between the Others and the Clan, and is bothered by the Others' derogatory language about the Clan. 2: The passage describes Ayla's thoughts and emotions, so there is no explicit reference to time. However, there are references to Ayla's past and the past of the Clan, which could imply the passage of years. Let's say that Ayla is reflecting on her past experiences and her current situation for about 10 minutes. 3: 10 minutes have elapsed. 4: 10 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
453	AuelJM.txt|153|u	 “Couldn't someone go with her?” Jondalar suggested. “The horse can take two. I've ridden double with her.”  Talut was smiling again. “That's a good idea! Who wants to go?”  “I'll go! I know the way,” a voice called out, followed quickly by a second. “I know the way. I just came from there.” Latie and Danug had both spoken up, and several others looked ready to.  Talut looked from one to the other, then shrugged his shoulders, holding out both hands, and turned to Ayla. “The choice is yours.”  Ayla looked at the youth, nearly as tall as Jondalar, with red hair the color of Talut's, and the pale fuzz of a beginning beard. Then at the tall, thin girl, not quite a woman but getting close, with dark blond hair a shade or two lighter than Nezzie's. There was earnest hope in both sets of eyes. She didn't know which one to choose. Danug was nearly a man. She thought she ought to take him, but something about Latie reminded Ayla of herself, and she remembered the look of longing she had seen on the girl's face the first time Latie saw the horses.  “I think Whinney go faster if not too much weight. Danug is man,” Ayla said, giving him a big, warm smile. “I think Latie better this time.”  Danug nodded, looking flustered, and backed off, trying to find a way to deal with the sudden flush of mixed emotions that had unexpectedly overwhelmed him. He was sorely disappointed that Latie was chosen, but Ayla's dazzling smile when she called him a man had caused the blood to rush to his face and his heart to beat faster—and an embarrassing tightening in his loins. 	1.0	2	[1, 2, 3, 0]	VALID	1: Ayla is trying to decide who should accompany her on a horse ride. Several people volunteer, and Ayla chooses Latie over Danug.  2: The passage describes a decision-making process that takes a few minutes at most.  3: Let's say two minutes have elapsed.  4: 2 minutes.  5: High confidence.
454	AuelJM.txt|176|u	 Another animal broke away, but Ayla managed to turn her around, too. Whinney seemed to know almost before the bison did which one would try next, but it was as much the woman's unconscious signals to the horse as the mare's intuitive sense that put her in the way of the shaggy animal. Ayla's training of Whinney had not been a conscious effort in the beginning. The first time she got on the horse's back had been sheer impulse, and no thought of controlling or directing entered her mind. It had happened gradually, as mutual understanding grew, and the control was exerted by tension of her legs and subtle shifts of her body. Though, eventually, she did begin to apply it purposefully, there was always an additional element of interaction between the woman and the horse, and they often moved as one, as though they shared one mind.  The instant Ayla moved, the others recognized the situation, and rushed to stop the herd. Ayla had chased herding animals with Whinney in the past, but she would not have been able to turn the bison around without help. The large humpbacked beasts were much harder to control than she imagined they would be. They'd been held back, and she had never tried to drive animals in a direction they didn't want to go. It was almost as though some instinctual sense warned them of the trap waiting for them. 	5.0	10	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: Ayla chases after a bison on horseback, and manages to turn it around with the help of her horse. She reflects on her relationship with the horse and her experience with herding animals. 2: The passage describes a single event, but there is some indication that Ayla has experience with herding animals and training horses. Let's say this event takes 10 minutes. 3: 10 minutes. 4: 10 minutes. 5: High confidence.
455	AuelJM.txt|296|u	 Jondalar's forehead furrowed with concern. Too much attention from Doni was not necessarily desirable. He had been told often enough how well favored he was; it hadn't brought him much happiness. Suddenly he remembered the words of the old white-haired Healer who had Served the Mother for the people of the Sharamudoi. The Shamud had told him once that the Mother favored him so much no woman could refuse him, not even the Mother Herself could refuse him—that was his gift—but warned him to be wary. Gifts from the Mother were not an unmixed blessing, they put one in Her debt. Did that mean Ayla was in Her debt?  Ayla wasn't sure if she liked the last gift very much. “I not know Mother, or gifts. I think Cave Lion, my totem, send Whinney.”  Mamut looked surprised. “The Cave Lion is your totem?” Ayla noticed his expression, and recalled how difficult it had been for the Clan to believe that a female could have a powerful male totem protecting her. “Yes. Mog-ur told me. Cave Lion choose me, and make mark. I show you,” Ayla explained. She untied the waist thong of the legged garment, and lowered the flap enough to expose her left thigh, and the four parallel scars made by a sharp claw, evidence of her encounter with a cave lion.  The marks were old, long healed, Mamut noted. She must have been quite young. How had a young girl escaped from a cave lion? “How did you get that mark?” he asked. 	1.0	0	[0, 3, 2, 1]	CALC ERROR	1: Jondalar and Ayla are discussing Ayla's totem, the Cave Lion. Ayla shows Mamut the scars on her leg from a cave lion attack and he asks how she got them. 2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage. The events described take place in conversation and memory, so no time has passed in the scene.  3: N/A 4: N/A 5: High confidence.
456	AuelJM.txt|496|u	 Tulie examined it critically, at first judging it to be simplistic because it lacked the additional design, either carved or painted, that she was accustomed to. But as she looked more closely, running her fingertips over the remarkably smooth finish, noting the perfect shape and symmetry, she had to concede that it was certainly a finely crafted piece of work, perhaps the finest piece of workmanship of its kind she had ever seen. As the bowl was passed around, it aroused the interest and curiosity about the other gifts Ayla had brought even more as each person wondered if every gift would be as beautifully unusual.  Talut came forward next and gave Ayla a big hug, then presented her with an ivory-handled flint knife in a red-dyed rawhide sheath which was carved with an intricate design, similar to the knife Deegie wore on her belt. Ayla took the knife out of the sheath, and immediately guessed that the blade had probably been made by Wymez, and suspected that Ranec had carved and shaped the handle.  Ayla brought out a heavy pile of dark fur for Talut. He grinned wide when he shook out the mantle made from an entire bison hide, and flung it over his shoulders. The thick mane and shoulder fur made the big man seem even bigger than he was, and he enjoyed the effect. Then he noticed the way it clung to his shoulders and hung down in pliant folds, and examined the soft and supple inside of the warm cloak more closely. 	3.0	10	[0, 3, 1, 2]	VALID	1: Ayla brings a finely crafted bowl as a gift, which impresses the people present. Talut gives Ayla an ivory-handled flint knife in a red-dyed rawhide sheath, and Ayla gives Talut a mantle made from an entire bison hide. 2: There are no explicit references to time in the passage.

And why she came for the roast meat, and wanted the ermine so much. Look at her ribs. The pups have been taking a lot out of her. She's hardly more than bones and fur. If she lived with a pack, they'd be helping her feed those pups, but if she lived with a pack, she would not have had pups. Only the female leader of a pack has pups, usually, and this wolf is the wrong color. Wolves get used to certain colors and marks. She's like that white wolf I used to watch when I was learning about them. They didn't like her either. She was always trying to make up to the female leader and the male leader, but they didn't want her around. After the pack got so big, she left. Maybe she got tired of no one liking her.”  Ayla looked down at the black wolf. “Like this one did. Maybe that's why she wanted to have pups, because she was lonely. But she shouldn't have had them so early. I think this is the same black wolf I saw when we hunted bison, Deegie. She must have left her pack to look for a lone male to start her own pack, new packs get started that way. But it's always hard on the loners.	2.0	262080	[1, 2, 3, 0]	VALID	1: Ayla and Deegie are discussing a black wolf who is out of season and having trouble finding food. They speculate that she is a loner and that her pups are taking a lot out of her. They also discuss the difficulties of being a loner wolf and the challenges of starting a new pack. 2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage. However, the discussion of the wolf's physical condition and the challenges of being a loner suggest that this is a long-term situation, perhaps spanning several months or even years. 3: Let's estimate that this situation has been ongoing for six months. That's 26 weeks x 7 days a week, so 182 days. At 24 hours a day, that's 4,368 hours. At 60 minutes an hour, that's 262,080 minutes. 4: 262,080 minutes. 5: Low confidence, as the estimate is based on speculation about the duration of the wolf's situation.
458	AuelJM.txt|685|u	 In a very real sense, it was a game, the very subtle and entirely serious game of comparative rank which is played by all social animals. It is the method by which individuals arrange themselves—horses in a herd, wolves in a pack, people in a community—so that they can live together. The game pits two opposing forces against each other, both equally important to survival: individual autonomy and community welfare. The object is to achieve dynamic equilibrium.  At times and under certain conditions individuals can be nearly autonomous. An individual can live alone and have no worry about rank, but no species can survive without interaction between individuals. The ultimate price would be more final than death. It would be extinction. On the other hand, complete individual subordination to the group is just as devastating. Life is neither static nor unchanging. With no individuality, there can be no change, no adaptation and, in an inherently changing world, any species unable to adapt is also doomed.  Humans in a community, whether it is as small as two people or as large as the world, and no matter what form the society takes, will arrange themselves according to some hierarchy. Commonly understood courtesies and customs can help to smooth the friction and ease the stress of maintaining a workable balance within this constantly changing system. In some situations most individuals will not have to compromise much of their personal independence for the welfare of the community. In others, the needs of the community may demand the utmost personal sacrifice of the individual, even to life itself. Neither is more right than the other, it depends on the circumstances; but neither extreme can be maintained for long, nor can a society last if a few people exercise their individuality at the expense of the community. 	52560000.0	0	[2, 1, 3, 0]	CALC ERROR	1: This passage is a philosophical reflection on the nature of social hierarchy and the balance between individual autonomy and community welfare.  2: The passage does not describe any specific events or time periods, but rather discusses a universal aspect of social organization.  3: N/A 4: N/A 5: N/A

Tell me this baby will live,” he pleaded. “Fralie, tell me this baby will live.”  “I can't tell you. I don't know.” Her voice was strained and hoarse.  “I thought you knew about these things, Fralie. You're a mother. You have two children already.”  “Each one is different,” she whispered. “This one has been difficult from the beginning. I was worried that I might lose it. There was so much trouble … finding a place to settle … I don't know. I just think it's too early for this baby to be born.”  “Why didn't you tell me, Fralie?”  “What would you have done about it?” Crozie said, her tone restrained, almost hopeless. “What could you do? Do you know anything about pregnancy? Childbirth? Coughs? Pain? She didn't want to tell you because you've done nothing but insult the one who could help her. Now the child will die, and I don't know how weak Fralie is.”  Frebec turned to Crozie. “Fralie? Nothing can happen to Fralie! Can it? Women have babies all the time.”  “I don't know, Frebec. Look at her, judge for yourself.”  Fralie was trying to control a cough that threatened, and the ache in her back was starting again. Her eyes were closed, and her brows drawn in. Her hair was tangled and stringy and her face shiny with sweat. Frebec jumped up and started to leave the hearth. “Where are you going, Frebec?” Fralie asked. 	2.0	240	[0, 1, 2, 3]	VALID	1: A man pleads with a woman named Fralie to tell him that her newborn baby will live. Fralie expresses doubt and explains that the baby has been difficult from the beginning. Another woman, Crozie, criticizes the man for not being supportive during Fralie's pregnancy. Fralie appears to be in pain and Frebec, the man, is worried about her. 2: There are no explicit references to time in the passage. However, the fact that Fralie has already given birth and that the baby is in danger suggests that at least a few hours have passed since the onset of labor. Let's say four hours. 3: Four hours have elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour that's 240 minutes. 4: 240 minutes. 5: High confidence.
460	AuelJM.txt|841|u	 “Wolf! What are you doing here? Did you run away from Rydag?” she said, as the puppy jumped up on her in greeting, pleased and excited to have found her. Then he began sniffing around the area while she gathered up her things.  “Well, now that you've found me, we can go back. Come on, Wolf Let's go. What are you after in those bushes … Jondalar!”  Ayla was stunned beyond words when she discovered what the young wolf had been after, and Jondalar was too embarrassed to speak, yet their eyes held, and spoke more than words could say. But they would not believe what they saw. Finally Jondalar attempted to explain.  “I was … uh … walking by, and … uh …”  He gave up, not even trying to finish his lame attempt at an excuse, turned and walked quickly away. Ayla followed him back toward the Camp more slowly, trudging up the slope toward the earthlodge. Jondalar's behavior confused her. She wasn't sure how long he had been there, but she knew he had been watching her, and wondered why he had been hiding from her. She didn't know what to think, but as she went into the lodge through the annex to the Mammoth Hearth to find Mamut so he could complete her preparations, she remembered the way Jondalar had looked at her. 	6.0	3	[3, 2, 1, 0]	VALID	1: Ayla is surprised to see her puppy, Wolf, and then sees Jondalar, who is embarrassed and leaves without explanation. Ayla follows him back to camp.  2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the events described seem to take only a few minutes.  3: Let's say three minutes have elapsed.  4: 3 minutes. 5: High confidence.

Jondalar had carved it, in the valley. When he made it, he said he wanted to capture her spirit so they would never be apart. That was why he made it to resemble her, even though no one was supposed to make an image in the likeness of an actual person, for fear of trapping the spirit. He said he wanted her to have the carving, so no one could use it for malicious purposes against her. It was her first muta, she realized. He gave it to her after her First Rites, when he had made her a real woman.  She would never forget that summer in her valley, just the two of them, together. But Jondalar was going to leave without her. She clutched the ivory figure to her chest and wished she was going with him. Wolf was whimpering at her in sympathy, inching forward because he knew he was supposed to stay where he was. She reached for him, and buried her face in his fur, while he tried to lick away her salty tears. 	2.0	525600	[3, 0, 1, 2]	VALID	1: A woman remembers a carving that her partner made of her, and the memories associated with it. She is crying and holding the carving while her dog tries to comfort her. 2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the woman is recalling events from the past. It is unclear how long ago these events took place, but they seem to be significant memories. Let's say the events took place over the course of a year. 3: One year has elapsed. At 365 days a year that's 365 days x 24 hours in a day, so 8760 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 525600 minutes. 4: 525600 minutes. 5: Low confidence, due to the ambiguity of the passage.

I don't want to live alone, why should Durc want to live alone in a valley with me?  I've been thinking of myself, not Durc. It would not be better for him to come here. It would not make him happy. It would only make me happy. But I am not Durc's mother any more. Uba is his mother. I am nothing to him but a memory of a mother who died, and maybe it's better that way. The Clan is his world, and like it or not, this is my world. I cannot go back to the Clan; Durc cannot come here. There is no place in this world where my son and I can live together, and be happy.  Ayla woke early the next morning. Even after she did finally go to sleep, she did not sleep well. She woke often from dreams of shaking earth and crumbling caves, and felt uneasy and depressed. She helped Nezzie heat water for soup and grind grains for a morning meal, and was glad for the opportunity to talk with her.  “I feel terrible about all the trouble I've caused, Nezzie. The whole Lion Camp is being shunned because of me,” Ayla said. 	1440.0	180	[0, 2, 3, 1]	VALID	1: Ayla considers the possibility of returning to the valley with her son Durc, but decides it would not be best for him. She wakes up early the next morning feeling uneasy and depressed, and talks to Nezzie about the trouble she has caused. 2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage, but Ayla wakes up early the next morning, suggesting that at least several hours have passed since she went to bed. The conversation with Nezzie and the meal preparation might take an hour or two. Let's say three hours have elapsed. 3: Three hours have elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour, that's 180 minutes. 4: 180 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

Ayla's destiny is much greater than anyone knows. The Mother has chosen her, and her life will have many challenges, and so will yours. She will have need of your protection, and the strength your love has gained. That is why you had to learn that lesson. It is never easy to be chosen, but there are always great benefits, too. Take care of her, Jondalar. You know, when she worries about others, she forgets to take care of herself.”  Jondalar nodded. Then Ayla hugged the old man, smiling through dewy eyes.  “I wish Rydag were here. I miss him so much. I learned lessons, too. I wanted to go back for my son, but Rydag taught me that I must let Durc live his own life. How can I thank you for everything, Mamut?”  “No thanks are necessary, Ayla. Our paths were meant to cross. I have been waiting for you without knowing it, and you have given me much joy, my daughter. You were never meant to go back for Durc. He was your gift to the Clan. Children are always a joy, but pain, too. And they all must lead their own lives. Even Mut will let Her children go their own way, someday, but I fear for us if we ever neglect Her. If we forget to respect our Great Earth Mother, She will withhold Her blessings, and no longer provide for us.”  Ayla and Jondalar mounted the horses, waved, and said last goodbyes. Most of the encampment had come to wish them a good Journey. As they started out, Ayla kept looking for one last person. But Ranec had already said his goodbyes and he could not face a more public farewell. 	30.0	3	[0, 3, 2, 1]	VALID	1: Ayla and Jondalar say goodbye to Mamut and the rest of the encampment, and Ayla expresses regret at not seeing Ranec one last time. 2: There are no explicit references to time, but the events described seem to take place over a few minutes at most.  3: Let's say 3 minutes have elapsed. 4: 3 minutes. 5: High confidence.

Ranec waved back, but in his other hand he held clutched to his breast a piece of ivory, carved into the shape of a transcendent bird-woman figure. Into every notch that was carved, every line that was etched, he had lovingly carved every hope of his aesthetic and sensitive soul. He had made it for Ayla, hoping it would charm her to his hearth, as he hoped his laughing eyes and sparkling wit would charm her to his heart. But as the artist of great talent and charm and laughter watched the woman he loved ride away, no smile graced his face, and his laughing black eyes were filled with tears. 	4.0	0	[1, 2, 3, 0]	CALC ERROR	1: Ayla sees Ranec holding a piece of ivory carved into a bird-woman figure, which he had made for her.

465	ageofinnocence.txt|0|u	I.  On a January evening of the early seventies, Christine Nilsson was singing in Faust at the Academy of Music in New York.  Though there was already talk of the erection, in remote metropolitan distances 'above the Forties,' of a new Opera House which should compete in costliness and splendour with those of the great European capitals, the world of fashion was still content to reassemble every winter in the shabby red and gold boxes of the sociable old Academy. Conservatives cherished it for being small and inconvenient, and thus keeping out the 'new people' whom New York was beginning to dread and yet be drawn to; and the sentimental clung to it for its historic associations, and the musical for its excellent acoustics, always so problematic a quality in halls built for the hearing of music.  It was Madame Nilsson's first appearance that winter, and what the daily press had already learned to describe as 'an exceptionally brilliant audience' had gathered to hear her, transported through the slippery, snowy streets in private broughams, in the spacious family landau, or in the humbler but more convenient 'Brown coupe.' To come to the Opera in a Brown coupe was almost as honourable a way of arriving as in one's own carriage; and departure by the same means had the immense advantage of enabling one (with a playful allusion to democratic principles) to scramble into the first Brown conveyance in the line, instead of waiting till the cold-and-gin congested nose of one's own coachman gleamed under the portico of the Academy. It was one of the great livery-stableman's most masterly intuitions to have discovered that Americans want to get away from amusement even more quickly than they want to get to it. 	180.0	180	[1, 3, 2, 0]	VALID	1: The passage describes an evening in the early 1870s when Christine Nilsson was singing in Faust at the Academy of Music in New York. The Academy was still popular despite talk of a new opera house being built. The audience arrived in various vehicles, including the 'Brown coupe,' and the livery-stableman had discovered that Americans want to leave entertainment quickly. 2: The passage describes a single evening, so the time elapsed is a few hours at most.  3: Let's say three hours have elapsed.  4: 180 minutes. 5: High confidence.
466	ageofinnocence.txt|1|u	 When Newland Archer opened the door at the back of the club box the curtain had just gone up on the garden scene. There was no reason why the young man should not have come earlier, for he had dined at seven, alone with his mother and sister, and had lingered afterward over a cigar in the Gothic library with glazed black-walnut bookcases and finial-topped chairs which was the only room in the house where Mrs. Archer allowed smoking. But, in the first place, New York was a metropolis, and perfectly aware that in metropolises it was 'not the thing' to arrive early at the opera; and what was or was not 'the thing' played a part as important in Newland Archer's New York as the inscrutable totem terrors that had ruled the destinies of his forefathers thousands of years ago.  The second reason for his delay was a personal one. He had dawdled over his cigar because he was at heart a dilettante, and thinking over a pleasure to come often gave him a subtler satisfaction than its realisation. This was especially the case when the pleasure was a delicate one, as his pleasures mostly were; and on this occasion the moment he looked forward to was so rare and exquisite in quality that--well, if he had timed his arrival in accord with the prima donna's stage-manager he could not have entered the Academy at a more significant moment than just as she was singing: 'He loves me--he loves me not--HE LOVES ME!--' and sprinkling the falling daisy petals with notes as clear as dew. 	120.0	36	[3, 0, 2, 1]	VALID	1: Newland Archer arrives at the opera late, just as the prima donna is singing a significant line. 2: The passage describes Newland's dinner and cigar, but doesn't give any explicit time markers. However, it does suggest that Newland is aware of the social norms of New York, which implies that he has been living there for some time. Let's say he's been living there for a year. The passage also describes the moment he arrives at the opera as 'significant,' which implies that he has missed some of the performance. Let's say he's missed the first 10 minutes.  3: Newland has been living in New York for a year and has missed the first 10 minutes of the opera. Let's say the opera is three hours long, so he has missed about 20% of it. Three hours is 180 minutes, so 20% of that is 36 minutes.  4: 36 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
467	ageofinnocence.txt|19|u	 The question was: who was Beaufort? He passed for an Englishman, was agreeable, handsome, ill-tempered, hospitable and witty. He had come to America with letters of recommendation from old Mrs. Manson Mingott's English son-in-law, the banker, and had speedily made himself an important position in the world of affairs; but his habits were dissipated, his tongue was bitter, his antecedents were mysterious; and when Medora Manson announced her cousin's engagement to him it was felt to be one more act of folly in poor Medora's long record of imprudences.  But folly is as often justified of her children as wisdom, and two years after young Mrs. Beaufort's marriage it was admitted that she had the most distinguished house in New York. No one knew exactly how the miracle was accomplished. She was indolent, passive, the caustic even called her dull; but dressed like an idol, hung with pearls, growing younger and blonder and more beautiful each year, she throned in Mr. Beaufort's heavy brown-stone palace, and drew all the world there without lifting her jewelled little finger. The knowing people said it was Beaufort himself who trained the servants, taught the chef new dishes, told the gardeners what hot-house flowers to grow for the dinner-table and the drawing-rooms, selected the guests, brewed the after-dinner punch and dictated the little notes his wife wrote to her friends. If he did, these domestic activities were privately performed, and he presented to the world the appearance of a careless and hospitable millionaire strolling into his own drawing-room with the detachment of an invited guest, and saying: 'My wife's gloxinias are a marvel, aren't they? I believe she gets them out from Kew.' 	1051200.0	259200	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The passage describes the rise of a wealthy couple in New York society.  2: The passage describes the couple's rise over two years, but doesn't give any specific events or time markers. We can guess that it took at least a few months to establish themselves in society, but it's hard to say how long the process took. Let's say six months.  3: Six months have elapsed. At 30 days a month that's 180 days x 24 hours in a day, so 4320 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 259200 minutes. 4: 259200 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the passage doesn't give any specific time markers.
468	ageofinnocence.txt|42|u	 'It's odd,' Janey remarked, 'that she should have kept such an ugly name as Ellen. I should have changed it to Elaine.' She glanced about the table to see the effect of this.  Her brother laughed. 'Why Elaine?'  'I don't know; it sounds more--more Polish,' said Janey, blushing.  'It sounds more conspicuous; and that can hardly be what she wishes,' said Mrs. Archer distantly.  'Why not?' broke in her son, growing suddenly argumentative. 'Why shouldn't she be conspicuous if she chooses? Why should she slink about as if it were she who had disgraced herself? She's 'poor Ellen' certainly, because she had the bad luck to make a wretched marriage; but I don't see that that's a reason for hiding her head as if she were the culprit.'  'That, I suppose,' said Mr. Jackson, speculatively, 'is the line the Mingotts mean to take.'  The young man reddened. 'I didn't have to wait for their cue, if that's what you mean, sir. Madame Olenska has had an unhappy life: that doesn't make her an outcast.'  'There are rumours,' began Mr. Jackson, glancing at Janey.  'Oh, I know: the secretary,' the young man took him up. 'Nonsense, mother; Janey's grown-up. They say, don't they,' he went on, 'that the secretary helped her to get away from her brute of a husband, who kept her practically a prisoner? Well, what if he did? I hope there isn't a man among us who wouldn't have done the same in such a case.' 	2.0	5	[2, 3, 1, 0]	VALID	1: A group of people are discussing a woman named Ellen, and one of them suggests that she should have changed her name to Elaine. They discuss whether Ellen should be more or less conspicuous, and the conversation turns to rumours about her secretary helping her escape from an abusive husband. 2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage. The conversation seems to be happening in real time, so let's estimate that it takes about five minutes. 3: 5 minutes have elapsed. 4: 5 minutes. 5: High confidence.

Mr. Jackson sank into the armchair with satisfaction, lit his cigar with perfect confidence (it was Newland who bought them), and stretching his thin old ankles to the coals, said: 'You say the secretary merely helped her to get away, my dear fellow? Well, he was still helping her a year later, then; for somebody met 'em living at Lausanne together.'  Newland reddened. 'Living together? Well, why not? Who had the right to make her life over if she hadn't? I'm sick of the hypocrisy that would bury alive a woman of her age if her husband prefers to live with harlots.'  He stopped and turned away angrily to light his cigar. 'Women ought to be free--as free as we are,' he declared, making a discovery of which he was too irritated to measure the terrific consequences.  Mr. Sillerton Jackson stretched his ankles nearer the coals and emitted a sardonic whistle.  'Well,' he said after a pause, 'apparently Count Olenski takes your view; for I never heard of his having lifted a finger to get his wife back.'    VI.  That evening, after Mr. Jackson had taken himself away, and the ladies had retired to their chintz-curtained bedroom, Newland Archer mounted thoughtfully to his own study. A vigilant hand had, as usual, kept the fire alive and the lamp trimmed; and the room, with its rows and rows of books, its bronze and steel statuettes of 'The Fencers' on the mantelpiece and its many photographs of famous pictures, looked singularly home-like and welcoming. 	180.0	15	[1, 2, 3, 0]	VALID	1: Newland Archer and Mr. Sillerton Jackson are in a library, discussing a woman who left her husband and is living with her secretary. Newland argues that women should be free to live as they choose, and Mr. Jackson notes that the woman's husband has not tried to get her back. Newland then goes to his study. 2: The events in the passage are described in detail, but there is no explicit reference to time. We can guess that the conversation between Newland and Mr. Jackson takes at least 10 minutes, and that Newland's trip to his study takes another 5 minutes.  3: 15 minutes have elapsed.  4: 15 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

'Have you forgotten,' he asked with a smile, 'that in our country we don't allow our marriages to be arranged for us?'  A dusky blush rose to her cheek, and he instantly regretted his words.  'Yes,' she answered, 'I'd forgotten. You must forgive me if I sometimes make these mistakes. I don't always remember that everything here is good that was--that was bad where I've come from.' She looked down at her Viennese fan of eagle feathers, and he saw that her lips trembled.  'I'm so sorry,' he said impulsively; 'but you ARE among friends here, you know.'  'Yes--I know. Wherever I go I have that feeling. That's why I came home. I want to forget everything else, to become a complete American again, like the Mingotts and Wellands, and you and your delightful mother, and all the other good people here tonight. Ah, here's May arriving, and you will want to hurry away to her,' she added, but without moving; and her eyes turned back from the door to rest on the young man's face.  The drawing-rooms were beginning to fill up with after-dinner guests, and following Madame Olenska's glance Archer saw May Welland entering with her mother. In her dress of white and silver, with a wreath of silver blossoms in her hair, the tall girl looked like a Diana just alight from the chase. 	2.0	3	[3, 0, 1, 2]	VALID	1: Archer and Madame Olenska are at a party. Archer makes a joke about arranged marriages, which Madame Olenska misunderstands and becomes upset. Archer tries to comfort her and she expresses her desire to become a complete American again. May Welland enters the room. 2: There are no explicit references to time in the passage. The events described, however, suggest that only a few minutes have passed. The party is just beginning to fill up with guests, and May Welland has just arrived.  3: Let's say three minutes have elapsed. 4: 3 minutes. 5: High confidence.
471	ageofinnocence.txt|117|u	 She said the words 'my husband' as if no sinister associations were connected with them, and in a tone that seemed almost to sigh over the lost delights of her married life. Archer looked at her perplexedly, wondering if it were lightness or dissimulation that enabled her to touch so easily on the past at the very moment when she was risking her reputation in order to break with it.  'I do think,' she went on, addressing both men, 'that the imprevu adds to one's enjoyment. It's perhaps a mistake to see the same people every day.'  'It's confoundedly dull, anyhow; New York is dying of dullness,' Beaufort grumbled. 'And when I try to liven it up for you, you go back on me. Come--think better of it! Sunday is your last chance, for Campanini leaves next week for Baltimore and Philadelphia; and I've a private room, and a Steinway, and they'll sing all night for me.'  'How delicious! May I think it over, and write to you tomorrow morning?'  She spoke amiably, yet with the least hint of dismissal in her voice. Beaufort evidently felt it, and being unused to dismissals, stood staring at her with an obstinate line between his eyes.  'Why not now?'  'It's too serious a question to decide at this late hour.'  'Do you call it late?'  She returned his glance coolly. 'Yes; because I have still to talk business with Mr. Archer for a little while.' 	1.0	5	[1, 3, 2, 0]	VALID	1: A woman speaks to two men about her husband and the pleasures of novelty. One of the men, Beaufort, invites her to a party, but she hesitates and says she needs to talk business with the other man, Archer. 2: There are no explicit references to time.

There was no appeal from her tone, and with a slight shrug he recovered his composure, took her hand, which he kissed with a practised air, and calling out from the threshold: 'I say, Newland, if you can persuade the Countess to stop in town of course you're included in the supper,' left the room with his heavy important step.  For a moment Archer fancied that Mr. Letterblair must have told her of his coming; but the irrelevance of her next remark made him change his mind.  'You know painters, then? You live in their milieu?' she asked, her eyes full of interest.  'Oh, not exactly. I don't know that the arts have a milieu here, any of them; they're more like a very thinly settled outskirt.'  'But you care for such things?'  'Immensely. When I'm in Paris or London I never miss an exhibition. I try to keep up.'  She looked down at the tip of the little satin boot that peeped from her long draperies.  'I used to care immensely too: my life was full of such things. But now I want to try not to.'  'You want to try not to?'  'Yes: I want to cast off all my old life, to become just like everybody else here.'  Archer reddened. 'You'll never be like everybody else,' he said.  She raised her straight eyebrows a little. 'Ah, don't say that. If you knew how I hate to be different!' 	2.0	50400	[0, 3, 2, 1]	VALID	1: Beaufort leaves the room after inviting Archer to supper. Archer and the Countess have a brief conversation about art and the Countess's desire to fit in. 2: There is no explicit reference to time. The conversation is brief, but there is some indication that the Countess is speaking of a change in her life, which might imply a longer period of time. Let's say five weeks. 3: Five weeks is 35 days. 24 hours in a day, so 840 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 50400 minutes. 4: 50400 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the estimate is based on a vague reference to a change in the Countess's life.

It's all stupid and narrow and unjust--but one can't make over society.'  'No,' she acquiesced; and her tone was so faint and desolate that he felt a sudden remorse for his own hard thoughts.  'The individual, in such cases, is nearly always sacrificed to what is supposed to be the collective interest: people cling to any convention that keeps the family together--protects the children, if there are any,' he rambled on, pouring out all the stock phrases that rose to his lips in his intense desire to cover over the ugly reality which her silence seemed to have laid bare. Since she would not or could not say the one word that would have cleared the air, his wish was not to let her feel that he was trying to probe into her secret. Better keep on the surface, in the prudent old New York way, than risk uncovering a wound he could not heal.  'It's my business, you know,' he went on, 'to help you to see these things as the people who are fondest of you see them. The Mingotts, the Wellands, the van der Luydens, all your friends and relations: if I didn't show you honestly how they judge such questions, it wouldn't be fair of me, would it?' He spoke insistently, almost pleading with her in his eagerness to cover up that yawning silence. 	1.0	5	[1, 2, 3, 0]	VALID	1: A man and a woman are having a conversation about a difficult decision. The man is trying to convince the woman to do something for the sake of society and family, but she seems desolate and he feels remorse for his hard thoughts.  2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage. The conversation seems to be happening in real time, so let's say it takes about five minutes.  3: 5 minutes. 4: 5 minutes. 5: High confidence.
474	ageofinnocence.txt|203|u	 The idea of this monstrous exposure of her person was so painful to her relations that they could have covered with gold the ingenious person who suddenly discovered that the chair was too wide to pass between the iron uprights of the awning which extended from the church door to the curbstone. The idea of doing away with this awning, and revealing the bride to the mob of dressmakers and newspaper reporters who stood outside fighting to get near the joints of the canvas, exceeded even old Catherine's courage, though for a moment she had weighed the possibility. 'Why, they might take a photograph of my child AND PUT IT IN THE PAPERS!' Mrs. Welland exclaimed when her mother's last plan was hinted to her; and from this unthinkable indecency the clan recoiled with a collective shudder. The ancestress had had to give in; but her concession was bought only by the promise that the wedding-breakfast should take place under her roof, though (as the Washington Square connection said) with the Wellands' house in easy reach it was hard to have to make a special price with Brown to drive one to the other end of nowhere.  Though all these transactions had been widely reported by the Jacksons a sporting minority still clung to the belief that old Catherine would appear in church, and there was a distinct lowering of the temperature when she was found to have been replaced by her daughter-in-law. Mrs. 	20160.0	10080	[2, 3, 1, 0]	VALID	1: The passage describes the preparations for a wedding, including the difficulty of getting the bride to the church without exposing her to the public.  2: The passage describes a series of negotiations and discussions, but doesn't give any explicit indication of how long they took. We can guess that the preparations for a wedding would take at least a few days, but it's hard to be more specific than that.  3: Let's say that the preparations took a week. At seven days a week that's 168 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 10080 minutes. 4: 10080 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because of the ambiguity of the passage.
475	ageofinnocence.txt|211|u	 Archer stared at the speaker so blankly that he repeated in still more apologetic accents: 'It'll be exactly the same, sir, I do assure you--' and May's eager voice broke out, covering the embarrassed silence: 'The same as Rhinebeck? The Patroon's house? But it will be a hundred thousand times better--won't it, Newland? It's too dear and kind of Mr. van der Luyden to have thought of it.'  And as they drove off, with the maid beside the coachman, and their shining bridal bags on the seat before them, she went on excitedly: 'Only fancy, I've never been inside it--have you? The van der Luydens show it to so few people. But they opened it for Ellen, it seems, and she told me what a darling little place it was: she says it's the only house she's seen in America that she could imagine being perfectly happy in.'  'Well--that's what we're going to be, isn't it?' cried her husband gaily; and she answered with her boyish smile: 'Ah, it's just our luck beginning--the wonderful luck we're always going to have together!'    XX.  'Of course we must dine with Mrs. Carfry, dearest,' Archer said; and his wife looked at him with an anxious frown across the monumental Britannia ware of their lodging house breakfast-table.  In all the rainy desert of autumnal London there were only two people whom the Newland Archers knew; and these two they had sedulously avoided, in conformity with the old New York tradition that it was not 'dignified' to force one's self on the notice of one's acquaintances in foreign countries. 	2.0	5	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: Archer and May are discussing a house they will be visiting. They then discuss dining with Mrs. Carfry, which May is anxious about.  2: There is no explicit reference to time. The passage describes a conversation and some thoughts. Let's say the conversation takes five minutes.  3: 5 minutes have elapsed.  4: 5 minutes.  5: High confidence.
476	ageofinnocence.txt|331|u	   XXX.  That evening when Archer came down before dinner he found the drawing-room empty.  He and May were dining alone, all the family engagements having been postponed since Mrs. Manson Mingott's illness; and as May was the more punctual of the two he was surprised that she had not preceded him. He knew that she was at home, for while he dressed he had heard her moving about in her room; and he wondered what had delayed her.  He had fallen into the way of dwelling on such conjectures as a means of tying his thoughts fast to reality. Sometimes he felt as if he had found the clue to his father-in-law's absorption in trifles; perhaps even Mr. Welland, long ago, had had escapes and visions, and had conjured up all the hosts of domesticity to defend himself against them.  When May appeared he thought she looked tired. She had put on the low-necked and tightly-laced dinner-dress which the Mingott ceremonial exacted on the most informal occasions, and had built her fair hair into its usual accumulated coils; and her face, in contrast, was wan and almost faded. But she shone on him with her usual tenderness, and her eyes had kept the blue dazzle of the day before.  'What became of you, dear?' she asked. 'I was waiting at Granny's, and Ellen came alone, and said she had dropped you on the way because you had to rush off on business. There's nothing wrong?' 	30.0	15	[3, 2, 1, 0]	VALID	1: Archer comes down to an empty drawing-room, and he and May dine alone. May appears to be tired and asks Archer where he's been. 2: There are no explicit references to time, but we can infer that Archer has been dressing and waiting for May for at least 15 minutes. May's tiredness might suggest a longer period of time, but it's not clear. Let's say 15 minutes to be conservative. 3: 15 minutes have elapsed. 4: 15 minutes. 5: High confidence.

(How time passes! It seems only yesterday that he was your best man, Newland)--and Countess Olenska--yes, I think that's all....'  Mrs. Welland surveyed her son-in-law affectionately. 'No one can say, Newland, that you and May are not giving Ellen a handsome send-off.'  'Ah, well,' said Mrs. Archer, 'I understand May's wanting her cousin to tell people abroad that we're not quite barbarians.'  'I'm sure Ellen will appreciate it. She was to arrive this morning, I believe. It will make a most charming last impression. The evening before sailing is usually so dreary,' Mrs. Welland cheerfully continued.  Archer turned toward the door, and his mother-in-law called to him: 'Do go in and have a peep at the table. And don't let May tire herself too much.' But he affected not to hear, and sprang up the stairs to his library. The room looked at him like an alien countenance composed into a polite grimace; and he perceived that it had been ruthlessly 'tidied,' and prepared, by a judicious distribution of ash-trays and cedar-wood boxes, for the gentlemen to smoke in.  'Ah, well,' he thought, 'it's not for long--' and he went on to his dressing-room.  Ten days had passed since Madame Olenska's departure from New York. 	14400.0	14400	[2, 1, 3, 0]	VALID	1: The passage describes a conversation between Mrs. Welland and Mrs. Archer about a party they are throwing for Ellen, who is leaving for Europe. Archer leaves the conversation and goes to his library, which has been tidied up for guests. The passage ends by noting that ten days have passed since Madame Olenska left New York. 2: The passage explicitly states that ten days have passed since Madame Olenska left New York.  3: 10 days have elapsed. At 24 hours a day that's 240 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 14400 minutes. 4: 14400 minutes. 5: High confidence.
478	ageofinnocence.txt|410|u	 Archer had not seen M. Riviere, or heard of him, for nearly thirty years; and that fact gave the measure of his ignorance of Madame Olenska's existence. More than half a lifetime divided them, and she had spent the long interval among people he did not know, in a society he but faintly guessed at, in conditions he would never wholly understand. During that time he had been living with his youthful memory of her; but she had doubtless had other and more tangible companionship. Perhaps she too had kept her memory of him as something apart; but if she had, it must have been like a relic in a small dim chapel, where there was not time to pray every day....  They had crossed the Place des Invalides, and were walking down one of the thoroughfares flanking the building. It was a quiet quarter, after all, in spite of its splendour and its history; and the fact gave one an idea of the riches Paris had to draw on, since such scenes as this were left to the few and the indifferent.  The day was fading into a soft sun-shot haze, pricked here and there by a yellow electric light, and passers were rare in the little square into which they had turned. Dallas stopped again, and looked up.  'It must be here,' he said, slipping his arm through his father's with a movement from which Archer's shyness did not shrink; and they stood together looking up at the house. 	14716800.0	900	[2, 3, 1, 0]	VALID	1: Archer and his son Dallas are walking through a quiet quarter of Paris, looking for a house. Archer reflects on the fact that he has not seen Madame Olenska in thirty years, and that she has lived a life he cannot fully understand.  2: The passage describes a walk through a quiet quarter of Paris, and some reflection on the past. The walk might take 10-15 minutes, but the reflection on the past is harder to quantify. Let's say it takes 5 minutes.  3: 15 minutes have elapsed. Multiplying by 60 minutes an hour that's 900 minutes.  4: 900 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.
479	ageofinnocence.txt|412|u	Archer sat down on the bench and continued to gaze at the awninged balcony. He calculated the time it would take his son to be carried up in the lift to the fifth floor, to ring the bell, and be admitted to the hall, and then ushered into the drawing-room. He pictured Dallas entering that room with his quick assured step and his delightful smile, and wondered if the people were right who said that his boy 'took after him.' Then he tried to see the persons already in the room--for probably at that sociable hour there would be more than one--and among them a dark lady, pale and dark, who would look up quickly, half rise, and hold out a long thin hand with three rings on it.... He thought she would be sitting in a sofa-corner near the fire, with azaleas banked behind her on a table. 'It's more real to me here than if I went up,' he suddenly heard himself say; and the fear lest that last shadow of reality should lose its edge kept him rooted to his seat as the minutes succeeded each other.	5.0	40	[1, 0, 2, 3]	VALID	1: Archer is sitting on a bench, imagining his son Dallas entering a room and meeting a dark lady with three rings on her hand. He calculates how long it would take for Dallas to arrive and thinks about the scene in detail.  2: There is no explicit reference to time, but Archer is calculating how long it would take for his son to arrive, which suggests that he is waiting for him. He is also imagining a detailed scene, which could take some time. Let's say he waits for 30 minutes and spends 10 minutes imagining the scene.  3: 40 minutes have elapsed.  4: 40 minutes.  5: Moderate confidence.

At length a light shone through the windows, and a moment later a man-servant came out on the balcony, drew up the awnings, and closed the shutters.  At that, as if it had been the signal he waited for, Newland Archer got up slowly and walked back alone to his hotel.  	30.0	60	[1, 3, 0, 2]	VALID	1: Newland Archer sits on a bench for a long time, watching a balcony. A man-servant eventually comes out and closes the shutters. Archer then gets up and walks back to his hotel. 2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the passage suggests that Archer is waiting for something to happen and that it takes a while. Let's say he waits for an hour. 3: 1 hour has elapsed. 60 minutes in an hour, so 60 minutes. 4: 60 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
481	MitcMG.txt|0|u	   PART ONE      Chapter One   SCARLETT O'HARA WAS NOT BEAUTIFUL, but men seldom realized it when caught by her charm as the Tarleton twins were. In her face were too sharply blended the delicate features of her mother, a Coast aristocrat of French descent, and the heavy ones of her florid Irish father. But it was an arresting face, pointed of chin, square of jaw. Her eyes were pale green without a touch of hazel, starred with bristly black lashes and slightly tilted at the ends. Above them, her thick black brows slanted upward, cutting a startling oblique line in her magnolia-white skin—that skin so prized by Southern women and so carefully guarded with bonnets, veils and mittens against hot Georgia suns.  Seated with Stuart and Brent Tarleton in the cool shade of the porch of Tara, her father's plantation, that bright April afternoon of 1861, she made a pretty picture. Her new green flowered-muslin dress spread its twelve yards of billowing material over her hoops and exactly matched the flat-heeled green morocco slippers her father had recently brought her from Atlanta. The dress set off to perfection the seventeen-inch waist, the smallest in three counties, and the tightly fitting basque showed breasts well matured for her sixteen years. But for all the modesty of her spreading skirts, the demureness of hair netted smoothly into a chignon and the quietness of small white hands folded in her lap, her true self was poorly concealed. The green eyes in the carefully sweet face were turbulent, willful, lusty with life, distinctly at variance with her decorous demeanor. Her manners had been imposed upon her by her mother's gentle admonitions and the sterner discipline of her mammy; her eyes were her own. 	120.0	180	[0, 1, 2, 3]	VALID	1: The passage describes Scarlett O'Hara's appearance and behavior on a single afternoon in 1861. 2: The passage describes a single afternoon, so we can assume that it takes place over a few hours. The passage doesn't give any specific indication of how long the afternoon is, but we can assume it's at least two hours.  3: Let's say the passage takes place over three hours. At 60 minutes an hour, that's 180 minutes. 4: 180 minutes. 5: High confidence.
482	MitcMG.txt|1|u	 On either side of her, the twins lounged easily in their chairs, squinting at the sunlight through tall mint-garnished glasses as they laughed and talked, their long legs, booted to the knee and thick with saddle muscles, crossed negligently. Nineteen years old, six feet two inches tall, long of bone and hard of muscle, with sunburned faces and deep auburn hair, their eyes merry and arrogant, their bodies clothed in identical blue coats and mustard-colored breeches, they were as much alike as two bolls of cotton.  Outside, the late afternoon sun slanted down in the yard, throwing into gleaming brightness the dogwood trees that were solid masses of white blossoms against the background of new green. The twins' horses were hitched in the driveway, big animals, red as their masters' hair; and around the horses' legs quarreled the pack of lean, nervous possum hounds that accompanied Stuart and Brent wherever they went. A little aloof, as became an aristocrat, lay a black-spotted carriage dog, muzzle on paws, patiently waiting for the boys to go home to supper.  Between the hounds and the horses and the twins there was a kinship deeper than that of their constant companionship. They were all healthy, thoughtless young animals, sleek, graceful, high-spirited, the boys as mettlesome as the horses they rode, mettlesome and dangerous but, withal, sweet-tempered to those who knew how to handle them. 	1.0	180	[3, 0, 1, 2]	VALID	1: The passage describes two young men, twins, lounging outside in the sun with their dogs and horses.  2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the passage describes the sun as being in the late afternoon, so we can guess that the twins have been outside for a few hours. Let's say three hours.  3: Three hours have elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour that's 180 minutes. 4: 180 minutes. 5: High confidence.

It—it just surprised me.”  “It's lying you are!” said Gerald, and then, peering at her stricken face, he added in a burst of kindliness: “I'm sorry, daughter. But after all, you are nothing but a child and there's lots of other beaux.”  “Mother was only fifteen when she married you, and I'm sixteen,” said Scarlett, her voice muffled.  “Your mother was different,” said Gerald. “She was never flighty like you. Now come, daughter, cheer up, and I'll take you to Charleston next week to visit your Aunt Eulalie and, what with all the hullabaloo they are having over there about Fort Sumter, you'll be forgetting about Ashley in a week.”  “He thinks I'm a child,” thought Scarlett, grief and rage choking utterance, “and he's only got to dangle a new toy and I'll forget my bumps.”  “Now, don't be jerking your chin at me,” warned Gerald. “If you had any sense you'd have married Stuart or Brent Tarleton long ago. Think it over, daughter. Marry one of the twins and then the plantations will run together and Jim Tarleton and I will build you a fine house, right where they join, in that big pine grove and—”  “Will you stop treating me like a child!” cried Scarlett. “I don't want to go to Charleston or have a house or marry the twins. I only want—” She caught herself but not in time. 	2.0	5	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: A father and daughter argue about the daughter's romantic interest in a man who is not interested in her. The father tries to console her by suggesting she visit her aunt and forget about the man. The daughter resents being treated like a child. 2: There are no explicit references to time.

484	MitcMG.txt|91|u	 The house had been built according to no architectural plan whatever, with extra rooms added where and when it seemed convenient, but, with Ellen's care and attention, it gained a charm that made up for its lack of design. The avenue of cedars leading from the main road to the house—that avenue of cedars without which no Georgia planter's home could be complete—had a cool dark shadiness that gave a brighter tinge, by contrast, to the green of the other trees. The wisteria tumbling over the verandas showed bright against the whitewashed brick, and it joined with the pink crêpe myrtle bushes by the door and the white-blossomed magnolias in the yard to disguise some of the awkward lines of the house.  In springtime and summer, the Bermuda grass and clover on the lawn became emerald, so enticing an emerald that it presented an irresistible temptation to the flocks of turkeys and white geese that were supposed to roam only the regions in the rear of the house. The elders of the flocks continually led stealthy advances into the front yard, lured on by the green of the grass and the luscious promise of the cape jessamine buds and the zinnia beds. Against their depredations, a small black sentinel was stationed on the front porch. Armed with a ragged towel, the little negro boy sitting on the steps was part of the picture of Tara—and an unhappy one, for he was forbidden to chunk the fowls and could only flap the towel at them and shoo them. 	80640.0	0	[1, 0, 3, 2]	CALC ERROR	1: The passage describes the appearance of a house and its grounds, including an avenue of cedars, wisteria, crêpe myrtle bushes, magnolias, Bermuda grass, clover, turkeys, white geese, and a small black boy stationed on the front porch to keep the birds away. 2: The passage describes the appearance of the house and its grounds, but does not include any explicit reference to time. We can guess that the changes to the house and grounds took place over a period of years, but it's impossible to say how many.  3: N/A 4: N/A 5: High confidence that no specific amount of time is described.
485	MitcMG.txt|109|u	 When she had finished her prayers for those beneath the roof of Tara, her father, mother, sisters, three dead babies and “all the poor souls in Purgatory,” she clasped her white beads between long fingers and began the Rosary. Like the rushing of a soft wind, the responses from black throats and white throats rolled back:  “Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now, and at the hour of our death.”  Despite her heartache and the pain of unshed tears, a deep sense of quiet and peace fell upon Scarlett as it always did at this hour. Some of the disappointment of the day and dread of the morrow departed from her, leaving a feeling of hope. It was not the lifting up of her heart to God that brought this balm, for religion went no more than lip deep with her. It was the sight of her mother's serene face upturned to the throne of God and His saints and angels, praying for blessings on those whom she loved. When Ellen intervened with Heaven, Scarlett felt certain that Heaven heard.  Ellen finished and Gerald, who could never find his beads at prayer time, began furtively counting his decade on his fingers. As his voice droned on, Scarlett's thoughts strayed, in spite of herself. She knew she should be examining her conscience. Ellen had taught her that at the end of each day it was her duty to examine her conscience thoroughly, to admit her numerous faults and pray to God for forgiveness and strength never to repeat them. But Scarlett was examining her heart. 	5.0	15	[0, 3, 2, 1]	VALID	1: Scarlett is praying the Rosary with her family.

Chapter Eleven   ON AN AFTERNOON OF THE FOLLOWING WEEK, Scarlett came home from the hospital weary and indignant. She was tired from standing on her feet all morning and irritable because Mrs. Merriwether had scolded her sharply for sitting on a soldier's bed while she dressed his wounded arm. Aunt Pitty and Melanie, bonneted in their best, were on the porch with Wade and Prissy, ready for their weekly round of calls. Scarlett asked to be excused from accompanying them and went upstairs to her room.  When the last sound of carriage wheels had died away and she knew the family was safely out of sight, she slipped quietly into Melanie's room and turned the key in the lock. It was a prim, virginal little room and it lay still and warm in the slanting rays of the four-o'clock sun. The floors were glistening and bare except for a few bright rag rugs, and the white walls unornamented save for one corner which Melanie had fitted up as a shrine. 	240.0	10080	[1, 3, 0, 2]	VALID	1: Scarlett comes home from the hospital, tired and irritable. She declines to accompany her family on their weekly round of calls, and goes to her room. She then goes into Melanie's room and locks the door. 2: There are no explicit references to time in the passage. Scarlett's tiredness and irritability suggest that she has been working for some time, but we don't know how long. Similarly, the weekly round of calls suggests that at least a week has passed since the previous such round, but we don't know how much more than a week. Let's say a week has passed since the previous round of calls. 3: One week has elapsed. At seven days a week that's 7 days. 24 hours in a day, so 168 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 10080 minutes. 4: 10080 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because of the amount of speculation required.
487	MitcMG.txt|516|u	 The state militia who had gone out so short a time before, resplendent in new uniforms, could hardly be distinguished from the seasoned troops, so dirty and unkempt were they. There was a new look in their eyes. Three years of apologizing, of explaining why they were not at the front was behind them now. They had traded security behind the lines for the hardships of battle. Many of their number had traded easy living for hard death. They were veterans now, veterans of brief service, but veterans just the same, and they had acquitted themselves well. They searched out the faces of friends in the crowd and stared at them proudly, defiantly. They could hold up their heads now.  The old men and boys of the Home Guard marched by, the graybeards almost too weary to lift their feet, the boys wearing the faces of tired children, confronted too early with adult problems. Scarlett caught sight of Phil Meade and hardly recognized him, so black was his face with powder and grime, so taut with strain and weariness. Uncle Henry went limping by, hatless in the rain, his head stuck through a hole in a piece of old oilcloth. Grandpa Merriwether rode in on a gun carriage, his bare feet tied in quilt scraps. But search though she might, she saw no sign of John Wilkes. 	109440.0	194400	[0, 2, 1, 3]	VALID	1: The passage describes the return of a state militia from battle, and the appearance of the old men and boys of the Home Guard. The protagonist, Scarlett, searches for someone named John Wilkes but does not find him. 2: The passage does not include any explicit reference to time. However, the fact that the militia has returned from battle suggests that they have been gone for at least a few weeks or months. The weariness of the old men and boys in the Home Guard also suggests that they have been working for some time. Let's estimate that the militia has been gone for three months and the Home Guard has been working for six months. 3: The midpoint of three and six months is four and a half months. 4.5 months is 135 days. 24 hours in a day, so 3240 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 194400 minutes. 4: 194400 minutes. 5: Low confidence, as the estimate is based on speculation.
488	MitcMG.txt|652|u	 From the wagon the faint wailing sounded again and Gerald seemed to rouse himself with an effort.  “It's Melanie and her baby,” whispered Scarlett rapidly. “She's very ill—I brought her home.”  Gerald dropped his hand from her arm and straightened his shoulders. As he moved slowly to the side of the wagon, there was a ghostly semblance of the old host of Tara welcoming guests, as if Gerald spoke words from out of shadowy memory.  “Cousin Melanie!”  Melanie's voice murmured indistinctly.  “Cousin Melanie, this is your home. Twelve Oaks is burned. You must stay with us.”  Thoughts of Melanie's prolonged suffering spurred Scarlett to action. The present was with her again, the necessity of laying Melanie and her child on a soft bed and doing those small things for her that could be done.  “She must be carried. She can't walk.”  There was a scuffle of feet and a dark figure emerged from the cave of the front hall. Pork ran down the steps.  “Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett!” he cried.  Scarlett caught him by the arms. Pork, part and parcel of Tara, as dear as the bricks and the cool corridors! She felt his tears stream down on her hands as he patted her clumsily, crying: “Sho is glad you back! Sho is—”  Prissy burst into tears and incoherent mumblings: “Poke! Poke, honey!” And little Wade, encouraged by the weakness of his elders, began sniffling: “Wade thirsty!”  Scarlett caught them all in hand. 	1.5	120	[2, 3, 0, 1]	VALID	1: Scarlett and Gerald return to Tara with Melanie and her baby, who are both ill. Scarlett enlists the help of Pork, Prissy, and Wade to care for them. 2: There are no explicit references to time, but the events described seem to take place over a short period, perhaps an hour or two at most.  3: Let's say two hours have elapsed.  4: 120 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.

The little man went charging toward the back of the house and Scarlett breathed more easily. They had said nothing about burning the house. They hadn't told her to leave so they could fire it. Perhaps—perhaps—The men came rambling into the hall from the upstairs and the out of doors.  “Anything?” questioned the sergeant.  “One hog and a few chickens and ducks.”  “Some corn and a few yams and beans. That wildcat we saw on the horse must have given the alarm, all right.”  “Regular Paul Revere, eh?”  “Well, there ain't much here, Sarge. You got the pickin's. Let's move on before the whole country gets the news we're comin'.”  “Didja dig under the smokehouse? They generally buries things there.”  “Ain't no smokehouse.”  “Didja dig in the nigger cabins?”  “Nothin' but cotton in the cabins. We set fire to it.”  For a brief instant Scarlett saw the long hot days in the cotton field, felt again the terrible ache in her back, the raw bruised flesh of her shoulders. All for nothing. The cotton was gone.  “You ain't got much, for a fac', have you, lady?”  “Your army has been here before,” she said coolly. 	1.7	60	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: A group of soldiers come to a house and search it, finding little of value. Scarlett, the owner of the house, reflects on the loss of her cotton crop. 2: There is no explicit reference to time. The soldiers' search is described in detail, but it's unclear how long it takes. Let's guess that the search takes an hour.  3: One hour has elapsed. At 60 minutes an hour, that's 60 minutes. 4: 60 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
490	MitcMG.txt|1101|u	 Scarlett thought: What damnably queer people Yankees are! Those women seemed to think that because Uncle Peter was black, he had no ears to hear with and no feelings, as tender as their own, to be hurt. They did not know that negroes had to be handled gently, as though they were children, directed, praised, petted, scolded. They didn't understand negroes or the relations between the negroes and their former masters. Yet they had fought a war to free them. And having freed them, they didn't want to have anything to do with them, except to use them to terrorize Southerners. They didn't like them, didn't trust them, didn't understand them, and yet their constant cry was that Southerners didn't know how to get along with them.  Not trust a darky! Scarlett trusted them far more than most white people, certainly more than she trusted any Yankee. There were qualities of loyalty and tirelessness and love in them that no strain could break, no money could buy. She thought of the faithful few who remained at Tara in the face of the Yankee invasion when they could have fled or joined the troops for lives of leisure. But they had stayed. She thought of Dilcey toiling in the cotton fields beside her, of Pork risking his life in neighboring hen houses that the family might eat, of Mammy coming to Atlanta with her to keep her from doing wrong. She thought of the servants of her neighbors who had stood loyally beside their white owners, protecting their mistresses while the men were at the front, refugeeing with them through the terrors of the war, nursing the wounded, burying the dead, comforting the bereaved, working, begging, stealing to keep food on the tables. And even now, with the Freedmen's Bureau promising all manner of wonders, they still stuck with their white folks and worked much harder than they ever worked in slave times. But the Yankees didn't understand these things and would never understand them. 	5.0	1576800	[0, 1, 2, 3]	VALID	1: Scarlett O'Hara reflects on the attitudes of Yankees towards black people, and contrasts this with her own experience of the loyalty and hard work of the black people she knows. 2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but Scarlett reflects on the experience of the Civil War and its aftermath, so we can guess that the passage covers at least a few years. Let's say three years. 3: Three years have elapsed. At 365 days a year that's 1095 days x 24 hours in a day, so 26280 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 1576800 minutes. 4: 1576800 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time.

I got nothing against the Yankees and I think Miss Melly was right and the rest of those lady wild cats wrong. But the idea of me pulling weeds at my time of life and with my lumbago!”  Melanie was on the board of lady managers of the Orphans' Home and assisted in the collection of books for the newly formed Young Men's Library Association. Even the Thespians who gave amateur plays once a month clamored for her. She was too timid to appear behind the kerosene-lamp footlights, but she could make costumes out of croker sacks if they were the only material available. It was she who cast the deciding vote at the Shakespeare Reading Circle that the bard's works should be varied with those of Mr. Dickens and Mr. Bulwer-Lytton and not the poems of Lord Byron, as had been suggested by a young and, Melanie privately feared, very fast bachelor member of the Circle. 	50400.0	525600	[3, 1, 0, 2]	VALID	1: The passage describes Melanie's involvement in various community activities, including the Orphans' Home, the Young Men's Library Association, and the Shakespeare Reading Circle.  2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the passage describes Melanie's involvement in multiple organizations and activities, which suggests that some time has passed. Let's say that Melanie has been involved in these activities for a year. 3: One year has elapsed. At 365 days a year that's 365 days x 24 hours in a day, so 8760 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 525600 minutes. 4: 525600 minutes. 5: Low confidence, as the estimate is based on speculation.
492	MitcMG.txt|1456|u	 Even before Scarlett was able to be about again, she noticed Rhett's preoccupation with the baby and was somewhat nettled and embarrassed at his pride in her in front of callers. It was all very well for a man to love his child but she felt there was something unmanly in the display of such love. He should be offhand and careless, as other men were.  “You are making a fool of yourself,” she said irritably, “and I don't see why.”  “No? Well, you wouldn't. The reason is that she's the first person who's ever belonged utterly to me.”  “She belongs to me, too.”  “No, you have two other children. She's mine.”  “Great balls of fire!” said Scarlett. “I had the baby, didn't I? Besides honey, I belong to you.”  Rhett looked at her over the black head of the child and smiled oddly.  “Do you, my dear?”  Only the entrance of Melanie stopped one of those swift hot quarrels which seemed to spring up so easily between them these days. Scarlett swallowed her wrath and watched Melanie take the baby. The name agreed upon for the child was Eugenie Victoria, but that afternoon Melanie unwittingly bestowed a name that clung, even as “Pittypat” had blotted out all memory of Sarah Jane. 	11520.0	3	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: Scarlett is recovering from childbirth and notices Rhett's preoccupation with their baby. She is irritated by his pride in the baby and feels that it is unmanly. They have a brief argument about the baby's ownership. Melanie enters and takes the baby, and unwittingly gives her a nickname. 2: There are no explicit references to time in the passage. The events described take place in a single scene, so we can estimate that they take place over a few minutes. 3: Let's say three minutes have elapsed. 4: 3 minutes. 5: High confidence.
493	MitcMG.txt|1518|u	 After a long time, he knocked on her door and she said, trying to control her voice: “Come in.”  “Am I actually being invited into the sanctuary?” he questioned, opening the door. It was dark and she could not see his face. Nor could she make anything of his voice. He entered and closed the door.  “Are you ready for the reception?”  “I'm so sorry but I have a headache.” How odd that her voice sounded natural! Thank God for the dark! “I don't believe I'll go. You go, Rhett, and give Melanie my regrets.”  There was a long pause and he spoke drawlingly, bitingly in the dark.  “What a white livered, cowardly little bitch you are.”  He knew! She lay shaking, unable to speak. She heard him fumble in the dark, strike a match and the room sprang into light. He walked over to the bed and looked down at her. She saw that he was in evening clothes.  “Get up,” he said and there was nothing in his voice. “We are going to the reception. You will have to hurry.”  “Oh, Rhett, I can't. You see—”  “I can see. Get up.”  “Rhett, did Archie dare—”  “Archie dared. A very brave man, Archie.”  “You should have killed him for telling lies—”  “I have a strange way of not killing people who tell the truth. There's no time to argue now. Get up.”  She sat up, hugging her wrapper close to her, her eyes searching his face. It was dark and impassive. 	30.0	3	[2, 0, 1, 3]	VALID	1: Rhett enters a dark room and tells the occupant, who has a headache, that they need to go to a reception. The occupant refuses, and Rhett insults them.

Ah done hear him say time an' agin, you is de onlies' gret lady he knows.”  “But—”  Melanie rose to her feet, confused, her heart quailing at the thought of confronting Rhett. The thought of arguing with a man as grief crazed as the one Mammy depicted made her go cold. The thought of entering that brightly lighted room where lay the little girl she loved so much wrung her heart. What could she do? What could she say to Rhett that would ease his grief and bring him back to reason? For a moment she stood irresolute and through the closed door came the sound of her boy's treble laughter. Like a cold knife in her heart came the thought of him dead. Suppose her Beau were lying upstairs, his little body cold and still, his merry laughter hushed.  “Oh,” she cried aloud, in fright, and in her mind she clutched him close to her heart. She knew how Rhett felt. If Beau were dead, how could she put him away, alone with the wind and the rain and the darkness?  “Oh! Poor, poor Captain Butler!” she cried. “I'll go to him now, right away.”  She sped back to the dining room, said a few soft words to Ashley and surprised her little boy by hugging him close to her and kissing his blond curls passionately. 	1.2	5	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: Melanie is urged to talk to Rhett, but is hesitant. She thinks about her own child and how she would feel if he were dead. She decides to go to Rhett and hugs her son. 2: There are no explicit references to time, but Melanie's thoughts and actions suggest a few minutes of hesitation and then a quick return to the dining room.  3: Let's say five minutes have elapsed.  4: 5 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
495	MitcMG.txt|1696|u	 She had never understood either of the men she had loved and so she had lost them both. Now, she had a fumbling knowledge that, had she ever understood Ashley, she would never have loved him; had she ever understood Rhett, she would never have lost him. She wondered forlornly if she had ever really understood anyone in the world.  There was a merciful dullness in her mind now, a dullness that she knew from long experience would soon give way to sharp pain, even as severed tissues, shocked by the surgeon's knife, have a brief instant of insensibility before their agony begins.  “I won't think of it now,” she thought grimly, summoning up her old charm. “I'll go crazy if I think about losing him now. I'll think of it tomorrow.”  “But,” cried her heart, casting aside the charm and beginning to ache, “I can't let him go! There must be some way!”  “I won't think of it now,” she said again, aloud, trying to push her misery to the back of her mind, trying to find some bulwark against the rising tide of pain. “I'll—why, I'll go home to Tara tomorrow,” and her spirits lifted faintly. 	10.0	60	[3, 1, 0, 2]	VALID	1: The protagonist reflects on her past relationships and wonders if she has ever understood anyone. She tries to push away thoughts of losing someone and decides to go home to Tara tomorrow. 2: There are no explicit references to time, but the protagonist's thoughts and emotions seem to move quickly.

496	MitcMG.txt|1697|u	 She had gone back to Tara once in fear and defeat and she had emerged from its sheltering walls strong and armed for victory. What she had done once, some-how—please God, she could do again! How, she did not know. She did not want to think of that now. All she wanted was a breathing space in which to hurt, a quiet place to lick her wounds, a haven in which to plan her campaign. She thought of Tara and it was as if a gentle cool hand were stealing over her heart. She could see the white house gleaming welcome to her through the reddening autumn leaves, feel the quiet hush of the country twilight coming down over her like a benediction, feel the dews falling on the acres of green bushes starred with fleecy white, see the raw color of the red earth and the dismal dark beauty of the pines on the rolling hills.  She felt vaguely comforted, strengthened by the picture, and some of her hurt and frantic regret was pushed from the top of her mind. She stood for a moment remembering small things, the avenue of dark cedars leading to Tara, the banks of cape jessamine bushes, vivid green against the white walls, the fluttering white curtains. And Mammy would be there. Suddenly she wanted Mammy desperately, as she had wanted her when she was a little girl, wanted the broad bosom on which to lay her head, the gnarled black hand on her hair. Mammy, the last link with the old days.  With the spirit of her people who would not know defeat, even when it stared them in the face, she raised her chin. She could get Rhett back. She knew she could. There had never been a man she couldn't get, once she set her mind upon him.  “I'll think of it all tomorrow, at Tara. I can stand it then. Tomorrow, I'll think of some way to get him back. After all, tomorrow is another day.”   	5.0	1800	[3, 2, 0, 1]	VALID	1: A woman thinks about returning to her childhood home, Tara, to recover from a recent setback and plan her next move. She remembers the house and the people there, and feels comforted. She resolves to get Rhett back, but puts off thinking about it until tomorrow. 2: The passage describes the woman's thoughts and memories, which could take place over a few minutes or a few hours. There is no explicit reference to time, but the woman's thoughts are described in detail, suggesting that they take some time. Let's say 30 minutes. 3: 30 minutes have elapsed. Multiplying by 60 minutes in an hour, that's 1800 minutes. 4: 1800 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
497	SwifJGT.txt|0|l	THE PUBLISHER TO THE READER.  The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us on the mother's side. About three years ago, Mr. Gulliver growing weary of the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff, made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark, in Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet in good esteem among his neighbours.  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at Banbury in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should think fit. I have carefully perused them three times. The style is very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the author, after the manner of travellers, is a little too circumstantial. There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of proverb among his neighbours at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing, to say, it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoken it. 	26280000.0	0	[1, 2, 0, 3]	CALC ERROR	1: The passage is a preface to a book of travels written by Lemuel Gulliver.

498	SwifJGT.txt|1|l	 By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to send them into the world, hoping they may be, at least for some time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen, than the common scribbles of politics and party.  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several voyages, together with the minute descriptions of the management of the ship in storms, in the style of sailors; likewise the account of longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend, that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied. But I was resolved to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea affairs shall have led me to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them. And if any traveller hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came from the hands of the author, I will be ready to gratify him.  As for any further particulars relating to the author, the reader will receive satisfaction from the first pages of the book.  RICHARD SYMPSON.

ARTICLE III.  “‘That, whereas certain ambassadors arrived from the Court of Blefuscu, to sue for peace in his majesty's court, he, the said Flestrin, did, like a false traitor, aid, abet, comfort, and divert, the said ambassadors, although he knew them to be servants to a prince who was lately an open enemy to his imperial majesty, and in an open war against his said majesty.

An apartment at court provided for the author. He is in high favour with the queen. He stands up for the honour of his own country. His quarrels with the queen's dwarf.  The frequent labours I underwent every day, made, in a few weeks, a very considerable change in my health: the more my master got by me, the more insatiable he grew. I had quite lost my stomach, and was almost reduced to a skeleton. The farmer observed it, and concluding I must soon die, resolved to make as good a hand of me as he could. While he was thus reasoning and resolving with himself, a _sardral_, or gentleman-usher, came from court, commanding my master to carry me immediately thither for the diversion of the queen and her ladies. Some of the latter had already been to see me, and reported strange things of my beauty, behaviour, and good sense. Her majesty, and those who attended her, were beyond measure delighted with my demeanour. I fell on my knees, and begged the honour of kissing her imperial foot; but this gracious princess held out her little finger towards me, after I was set on the table, which I embraced in both my arms, and put the tip of it with the utmost respect to my lip.	40320.0	86400	[3, 0, 1, 2]	VALID	1: The author is bought by the queen and presented to the king. He disputes with the king's scholars, is given an apartment at court, and becomes a favorite of the queen. He quarrels with the queen's dwarf.  2: There are no explicit references to time, but the author's health deteriorates over the course of a few weeks. The events described in the passage probably took several weeks to a few months.  3: Let's say two months have elapsed. At 30 days a month that's 60 days. 24 hours in a day, so 1440 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 86400 minutes. 4: 86400 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because of the speculative nature of the estimate.
501	SwifJGT.txt|204|l	And, as truth always forces its way into rational minds, so this honest worthy gentleman, who had some tincture of learning, and very good sense, was immediately convinced of my candour and veracity. But further to confirm all I had said, I entreated him to give order that my cabinet should be brought, of which I had the key in my pocket; for he had already informed me how the seamen disposed of my closet. I opened it in his own presence, and showed him the small collection of rarities I made in the country from which I had been so strangely delivered. There was the comb I had contrived out of the stumps of the king's beard, and another of the same materials, but fixed into a paring of her majesty's thumb-nail, which served for the back. There was a collection of needles and pins, from a foot to half a yard long; four wasp stings, like joiner's tacks; some combings of the queen's hair; a gold ring, which one day she made me a present of, in a most obliging manner, taking it from her little finger, and throwing it over my head like a collar. I desired the captain would please to accept this ring in return for his civilities; which he absolutely refused. I showed him a corn that I had cut off with my own hand, from a maid of honour's toe; it was about the bigness of Kentish pippin, and grown so hard, that when I returned England, I got it hollowed into a cup, and set in silver. Lastly, I desired him to see the breeches I had then on, which were made of a mouse's skin. 	525600.0	5	[2, 0, 1, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator convinces a gentleman of his veracity by showing him a collection of rarities he collected in the country from which he was delivered.  2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage. The description of the rarities might take a few minutes, but the time it took to convince the gentleman is unclear.

502	SwifJGT.txt|208|l	 As I was on the road, observing the littleness of the houses, the trees, the cattle, and the people, I began to think myself in Lilliput. I was afraid of trampling on every traveller I met, and often called aloud to have them stand out of the way, so that I had like to have gotten one or two broken heads for my impertinence.  When I came to my own house, for which I was forced to inquire, one of the servants opening the door, I bent down to go in, (like a goose under a gate,) for fear of striking my head. My wife run out to embrace me, but I stooped lower than her knees, thinking she could otherwise never be able to reach my mouth. My daughter kneeled to ask my blessing, but I could not see her till she arose, having been so long used to stand with my head and eyes erect to above sixty feet; and then I went to take her up with one hand by the waist. I looked down upon the servants, and one or two friends who were in the house, as if they had been pigmies and I a giant. I told my wife, “she had been too thrifty, for I found she had starved herself and her daughter to nothing.” In short, I behaved myself so unaccountably, that they were all of the captain's opinion when he first saw me, and concluded I had lost my wits. This I mention as an instance of the great power of habit and prejudice. 	1440.0	3	[2, 1, 0, 3]	VALID	1: The narrator describes feeling like a giant in a world of Lilliputians after returning home from a journey.  2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but the narrator describes a series of actions that would take a few minutes at most.  3: Let's say three minutes have elapsed.  4: 3 minutes.  5: High confidence.

Upon the tenth day we were chased by two pirates, who soon overtook us; for my sloop was so deep laden, that she sailed very slow, neither were we in a condition to defend ourselves.  We were boarded about the same time by both the pirates, who entered furiously at the head of their men; but finding us all prostrate upon our faces (for so I gave order), they pinioned us with strong ropes, and setting guard upon us, went to search the sloop.  I observed among them a Dutchman, who seemed to be of some authority, though he was not commander of either ship. He knew us by our countenances to be Englishmen, and jabbering to us in his own language, swore we should be tied back to back and thrown into the sea. I spoken Dutch tolerably well; I told him who we were, and begged him, in consideration of our being Christians and Protestants, of neighbouring countries in strict alliance, that he would move the captains to take some pity on us. This inflamed his rage; he repeated his threatenings, and turning to his companions, spoke with great vehemence in the Japanese language, as I suppose, often using the word _Christianos_. 	14400.0	45	[3, 0, 2, 1]	VALID	1: The passage describes a sea voyage that is interrupted by a storm and then by pirates. The pirates board the ship and threaten to throw the English passengers into the sea. One of the pirates, a Dutchman, is addressed in Dutch by one of the English passengers. 2: The passage describes events that take place over ten days, with three days of sailing, five days of being driven off course, and two days of being chased by pirates. The boarding and the conversation with the Dutchman probably take less than an hour.  3: The events in the passage take place over ten days, or 14400 minutes. The boarding and conversation with the Dutchman take less than an hour, so let's say 45 minutes.  4: 45 minutes. 5: High confidence.

I then put myself in the most supplicating posture, and spoke in the humblest accent, but received no answer. Those who stood nearest over against me, seemed to be persons of distinction, as I supposed by their habit. They conferred earnestly with each other, looking often upon me. At length one of them called out in a clear, polite, smooth dialect, not unlike in sound to the Italian: and therefore I returned an answer in that language, hoping at least that the cadence might be more agreeable to his ears. Although neither of us understood the other, yet my meaning was easily known, for the people saw the distress I was in.  They made signs for me to come down from the rock, and go towards the shore, which I accordingly did; and the flying island being raised to a convenient height, the verge directly over me, a chain was let down from the lowest gallery, with a seat fastened to the bottom, to which I fixed myself, and was drawn up by pulleys.

But what I chiefly admired, and thought altogether unaccountable, was the strong disposition I observed in them towards news and politics, perpetually inquiring into public affairs, giving their judgments in matters of state, and passionately disputing every inch of a party opinion. I have indeed observed the same disposition among most of the mathematicians I have known in Europe, although I could never discover the least analogy between the two sciences; unless those people suppose, that because the smallest circle has as many degrees as the largest, therefore the regulation and management of the world require no more abilities than the handling and turning of a globe; but I rather take this quality to spring from a very common infirmity of human nature, inclining us to be most curious and conceited in matters where we have least concern, and for which we are least adapted by study or nature. 	0	0	[1, 3, 2, 0]	CALC ERROR	1: The narrator describes his admiration for the curiosity of mathematicians and astronomers, but finds it strange that they are also interested in politics. 2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage.  3: N/A 4: N/A 5: High confidence.

The place is stored with great variety of sextants, quadrants, telescopes, astrolabes, and other astronomical instruments. But the greatest curiosity, upon which the fate of the island depends, is a loadstone of a prodigious size, in shape resembling a weaver's shuttle. It is in length six yards, and in the thickest part at least three yards over. This magnet is sustained by a very strong axle of adamant passing through its middle, upon which it plays, and is poised so exactly that the weakest hand can turn it. It is hooped round with a hollow cylinder of adamant, four feet yards in diameter, placed horizontally, and supported by eight adamantine feet, each six yards high. In the middle of the concave side, there is a groove twelve inches deep, in which the extremities of the axle are lodged, and turned round as there is occasion.  The stone cannot be removed from its place by any force, because the hoop and its feet are one continued piece with that body of adamant which constitutes the bottom of the island. 	0	394560	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: The passage describes a cave on an island, which contains twenty lamps and a variety of astronomical instruments. The most important object in the cave is a large loadstone, which is held in place by a strong axle of adamant and a cylinder of adamant.  2: The passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, but it does describe the physical characteristics of the objects in the cave in great detail. It's possible that the construction of the cave and the objects within it took several years, but it's also possible that they were created relatively quickly. Given the lack of information, it seems reasonable to estimate that the construction of the cave and its contents took several months to a year.  3: Let's say that the construction of the cave and its contents took 9 months.

When all was ready, and the day came for my departure, I took leave of my master and lady and the whole family, my eyes flowing with tears, and my heart quite sunk with grief. But his honour, out of curiosity, and, perhaps, (if I may speak without vanity,) partly out of kindness, was determined to see me in my canoe, and got several of his neighbouring friends to accompany him. I was forced to wait above an hour for the tide; and then observing the wind very fortunately bearing toward the island to which I intended to steer my course, I took a second leave of my master: but as I was going to prostrate myself to kiss his hoof, he did me the honour to raise it gently to my mouth. I am not ignorant how much I have been censured for mentioning this last particular.

I was conveyed to his own house; and at my earnest request he led me up to the highest room backwards. I conjured him “to conceal from all persons what I had told him of the _Houyhnhnms_; because the least hint of such a story would not only draw numbers of people to see me, but probably put me in danger of being imprisoned, or burnt by the Inquisition.” The captain persuaded me to accept a suit of clothes newly made; but I would not suffer the tailor to take my measure; however, Don Pedro being almost of my size, they fitted me well enough. He accoutred me with other necessaries, all new, which I aired for twenty-four hours before I would use them.  The captain had no wife, nor above three servants, none of which were suffered to attend at meals; and his whole deportment was so obliging, added to very good human understanding, that I really began to tolerate his company. He gained so far upon me, that I ventured to look out of the back window. By degrees I was brought into another room, whence I peeped into the street, but drew my head back in a fright. In a week's time he seduced me down to the door. I found my terror gradually lessened, but my hatred and contempt seemed to increase.

It's unclear how long the voyage to Lisbon took, but let's assume it was a few weeks. The narrator spends a week in the captain's house before venturing outside, and then walks around with the captain for an unspecified amount of time.

The names of all which virtues are still retained among us in most languages, and are to be met with in modern, as well as ancient authors; which I am able to assert from my own small reading.  But I had another reason, which made me less forward to enlarge his majesty's dominions by my discoveries. To say the truth, I had conceived a few scruples with relation to the distributive justice of princes upon those occasions. For instance, a crew of pirates are driven by a storm they know not whither; at length a boy discovers land from the topmast; they go on shore to rob and plunder, they see a harmless people, are entertained with kindness; they give the country a new name; they take formal possession of it for their king; they set up a rotten plank, or a stone, for a memorial; they murder two or three dozen of the natives, bring away a couple more, by force, for a sample; return home, and get their pardon. Here commences a new dominion acquired with a title by divine right. Ships are sent with the first opportunity; the natives driven out or destroyed; their princes tortured to discover their gold; a free license given to all acts of inhumanity and lust, the earth reeking with the blood of its inhabitants: and this execrable crew of butchers, employed in so pious an expedition, is a modern colony, sent to convert and civilize an idolatrous and barbarous people! 	20160.0	0	[1, 3, 0, 2]	CALC ERROR	1: The narrator expresses a wish that Europeans could learn from the virtues of other cultures, rather than trying to conquer them.

513	Van MF.txt|0|l	FAIRFAX AND HIS PRIDE     BOOK I  THE KINSMEN     CHAPTER I   One bitter day in January in the year 1880, when New York was a tranquil city, a young man stood at the South Ferry waiting for the up-town horse car. With a few other passengers he had just left the packet which had arrived in New York harbour that afternoon from New Orleans.  Antony Fairfax was an utter stranger to the North.  In his hand he carried a small hand-bag, and by his side on the snow rested his single valise. Before him waited a red and yellow tram-car drawn by lean horses, from whose backs the vapour rose on the frosty air. Muffled to his ears, the driver beat together his hands in their leather gloves; the conductor stamped his feet. The traveller climbed into the car, lifting his big bag after him.  The cold was even more terrible to him than to the conductor and driver. He had come from the South, where he had left the roses and magnolias in bloom, and the warmth of the country was in his blood. He dug his feet into the straw covering the floor of the car, buttoned his coat tight about his neck, pushed his hands deep in his pockets and sat wondering at the numbing cold.  This, then, was the North! 	15.0	60	[1, 3, 0, 2]	VALID	1: A young man named Antony Fairfax arrives in New York City from New Orleans on a cold day in January in the year 1880. He waits for a horse-drawn tram to take him uptown. 2: The passage describes only the arrival of Antony Fairfax in New York City and his waiting for a horse-drawn tram. The events described would have taken no more than an hour. 3: 1 hour. 4: 60 minutes. 5: High confidence.
514	Van MF.txt|1|l	 He watched with interest the few other passengers board the little car: two fruit vendors and after them were amiably lifted in great bunches of bananas. Antony asked himself the question whether this new country would be friendly to him, what would its spirit be toward him, and as he asked this question of the cold winter air the city suddenly took reality and formed for him out of his dreams. Would it be kind or cruel? The coming days would answer: meanwhile he could wait. Some places, like some people whom we meet, at once extend to us a hand; there are some that even seem to offer an embrace. Through the car blew a sudden icy blast and New York's welcome to Fairfax was keen as a blow. There was an actual physical affront in this wind that struck him in the face.  Suppose the elements were an indication of what the rest would be? But no--that was ridiculous! There would be certainly warm interiors behind the snow-fretted panes of the windows in the houses that lined the streets on either side. There would be warm and cordial hearts to welcome him somewhere. There would be understanding of heart, indulgence for youth. He would find open doors for all his ambitions, spurs to his integrity and effort. He would know how to make use of these ways and means of progress. For years he had dreamed of the galleries of pictures and of the museum. It was from this wonderful city whose wideness had the intense outreach of the unknown that Fairfax had elected to step into the world. 	0.33320000000000005	45	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: A man named Antony is on a train in New York City, wondering whether the city will be friendly to him. He imagines the city as a person, and feels a cold wind as a physical affront. He tries to reassure himself that there will be warm and welcoming people in the city. 2: The passage describes Antony's thoughts and feelings, but doesn't include any explicit reference to time. We can guess that the train ride might take 30 minutes to an hour, but the rest of the passage is purely internal and could take place in a matter of seconds.  3: Let's say 45 minutes have elapsed, including the train ride and any time Antony spent waiting for the train or boarding it.  4: 45 minutes. 5: Low confidence, since most of the passage is internal and could take place in a matter of seconds.

We have to put it far away off,' she explained, ''cause we're beginning early.'  Fairfax left them, touched by their patience in watching for the mother bird. He promised to return soon, soon, to go on with his wonderful tales. As he went downstairs Bella called after him.  'But you didn't say _which_ car you bet on, Cousin Antony.'  And Fairfax called back in his Southern drawl: 'I reckon she'll come in a pumpkin chariot.' And he heard their delighted giggles as he limped downstairs.     CHAPTER IX   He avoided his uncle, Mr. Carew, and made up his mind that if the master of the house were brusque to him, he would not return, were the threshold worn never so dear by little feet. Bella had the loveliest little feet a fellow connoisseur of plastic beauty could wish to see, could wish to watch twinkle in run-down slippers, in scuffled boots--in boots where a button or two was always lacking--and once when she kicked off her strap slipper at a lesson Fairfax saw, through a hole in the stocking, one small perfect toe--a toe of Greek marble perfection, a most charming, snowy, rosy bit of flesh, and he imagined how adorable the little foot must be. 	5.0	5	[2, 1, 0, 3]	VALID	1: The passage describes a conversation between a brother and sister, who are betting on when a mother bird will return, and their cousin Antony, who tells them stories. The passage then shifts to describe the protagonist's thoughts about his uncle and his attraction to his cousin's feet.  2: The conversation about the bird and the bet probably takes a few minutes. The protagonist's thoughts are not described in detail, but the passage suggests that they are brief. Let's say five minutes total.  3: Five minutes have elapsed.  4: 5 minutes.  5: High confidence.

Just here Rainsford leaned over and put his hand on Antony's sleeve. 'I want to say a word to you about your wife. I don't think she's very well.'  'Molly?' answered his companion calmly. 'She's all right. She has a mighty fine constitution, and I never heard her complain. When did you see her, Rainsford?' He frowned.  'Saturday, when you were in New York. You forgot to send your pass-book, and I went for it myself.'  'Well?' queried Antony. 'What then?'  'Mrs. Fairfax gave me the book, and I stopped to speak with her for a few moments. I find her very much changed.'  The light died from the young man's illumined face where his visions had kindled a sacred fire. The realities of life blotted it out.  'I'm not able to give Molly any distractions, that you know.'  'She doesn't want them, Tony.' Rainsford looked kindly and affectionately, almost tenderly, at him, and repeated gently: 'She doesn't want amusement, Tony.'  And Fairfax threw up his head with a sort of despair on his face--  'My God, Rainsford,' he murmured, 'what can I do?'  'I'm afraid she's breaking her heart,' said the older man. 'Poor little woman!' 	1.5	43200	[1, 0, 3, 2]	VALID	1: Two men are talking about one of their wives, who is apparently unwell. The husband is preoccupied with thoughts of transforming his kitchen into a studio.  2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the conversation suggests that the wife's condition has been deteriorating for some time. Let's say a month has passed since the wife's health began to decline.  3: One month is 30 days. 24 hours in a day, so 720 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 43200 minutes. 4: 43200 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because the passage is vague about the timeline.

The evening was warm. Molly wore a print dress, and in her bodice he saw that she had thrust a spray of pink geranium from the window-boxes that Antony had made and filled for her. Nothing that had claim to beauty failed to touch his senses, and he saw the charm of the picture in the pale spring light. He had softly turned the door-handle, and as there was a hand-organ playing without and Molly listening to the music, he entered without her hearing him.  'Is it yourself?' she exclaimed, startled. 'You're home early, Tony.'  He told her that he had come to take her for a little walk, and as she moved out of the light and came toward him, he thought he knew what Rainsford had meant. She was thin and yet not thin. The roundness had gone from her cheeks, and there was a mild sadness in her eyes. 	0.4998	90	[1, 0, 2, 3]	VALID	1: Fairfax comes home and finds Molly sitting by the window. He tells her he wants to take her for a walk.  2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the passage describes the light as 'pale,' suggesting it is early evening. Fairfax has come home early, so let's say it's around 5 or 6 pm. The walk would probably take an hour or so.  3: Let's say 1.5 hours have elapsed. 90 minutes. 4: 90 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
518	Van MF.txt|229|l	 To the agent who had accepted the Fairfax hospitality and come to supper, Tony said--  'To ease my soul, Peter, I want to tell you of something I did.'  Molly had washed the dishes and put them away, and, with a delicate appreciation of her husband's wish to be alone with his friend, went into the next room.  'After mother died my old nigger mammy in New Orleans sent me a packet of little things. I could never open the parcel until the other day. Amongst the treasures was a diamond ring, Rainsford, one I had seen her wear when I was a little boy. I took it to a jeweller on Market Street, and he told me it was worth a thousand dollars.'  Here Tony remained silent so long that his companion said--  'That's a lot of money, Tony.'  'Well, it came to me,' said the young man simply, 'like a gift from her. I asked them to lend me five hundred dollars on it for a year. It seems that it's a peculiarly fine stone, and they didn't hesitate.'  Rainsford was smoking a peaceful pipe, and he held the bowl affectionately in his hand, his attention fixed on the blond young man sitting in the full light of the evening. The night was warm, Fairfax was in snowy shirt-sleeves, his bright hair cropped close revealed the beautiful lines of his head; he was a powerful man, clean in habits of body and mind, and his expression as he talked was brilliant and fascinating, his eyes profound and blue. Around his knees he clasped the hands that drove an engine and ached to model in plaster and clay. His big shoe was a deformity, otherwise he was superb. 	2.0	0	[3, 2, 1, 0]	VALID	1: Tony tells his friend Peter about a diamond ring he inherited from his mother's old nanny.

519	Van MF.txt|251|l	She had brought much grace to it and much love. She had given a great deal. To wait for return, for such gifts, was to wait for the unattainable.  She went through the open door that she saw open, perhaps not all unwillingly; and she was not alone, for the child went with her, and they came to Fairfax and told him that she had gone through gently murmuring his name.     CHAPTER XXXIV   As Nut Street, with the destruction of his little statue, had been wiped out of his history, so the two rooms overlooking the river and steamboats knew Antony Fairfax no more. He turned the key in the door the day they carried away the body of his wife, and when he came back from the snowy earth and the snowy white city where he left her with his hour-old child, he went to the Delavan House as he had done before, and buried his head in his arms on his lowly bed in a hotel room and wept.  The following day he sent word to Rainsford to look out for another engineer in his place. He had driven his last trip.  Tito Falutini wrung his friend's hand, and told Fairfax, in his broken Italian-English, that he knew a fellow would take the rooms as they stood. 'Would Tony give the job to him?' Save for his clothes and Molly's things, and they were few, he took nothing, not even the drawings decorating the wall on which other Irish eyes should look with admiration. 	2880.0	1051200	[1, 3, 2, 0]	VALID	1: This passage describes the aftermath of a woman's death. Fairfax, the woman's husband, leaves their home and gives up his job as an engineer.  2: The passage describes the day of the woman's death and the day after. It's unclear how long Fairfax and his wife had lived in the two rooms overlooking the river. Let's say they lived there for a year.  3: Two days have elapsed. At 365 days a year that's 730 days. 24 hours in a day, so 17520 hours. 60 minutes in an hour, so 1,051,200 minutes. 4: 1,051,200 minutes. 5: Low confidence, because of the ambiguity about how long Fairfax and his wife lived in the two rooms.

'I'm light--I'll risk it,' and, half defiantly, she seated herself by the table, leaning both elbows on it. She looked back at him. 'Now, make a little drawing of me as you used to do. I'll show it to the girls in school to prove what a genius we have in the family; and I must go back, too, or I'll have more bad marks than ever.'  Fairfax did not obey her. Instead, he looked at her as though he saw through her to eternity.  Bella sprang up impulsively, and came toward him. 'Cousin Antony,' she murmured, 'I'm perfectly dreadful. I'm selfish and inconsiderate. It's only because I'm a little wild. I don't mean it. You've told me nothing.' She lifted his cravat from the chair. 'You wear a black cravat and your clothes are black. Is it for Aunt Arabella still?'  Fairfax seemed to himself to look down on her from a height. Her brilliance, her sparkle and youth were far away. His heart ached within him.  'One goes mighty far in five years, Bella.... One loses many things.'  'I know--Gardiner and your mother. But who else?'  He saw her face sadden; the young girl extended her hand to him, her eyes darkened.  'Who else?' she breathed. 	2.0	5	[2, 0, 1, 3]	VALID	1: A young woman named Bella sits in a chair and asks her cousin Antony to draw her.

521	Van MF.txt|286|l	 A good-looking young man of twenty-five, not more, with a cheerful, intelligent face in sober moments, now pale, with parched lips and eyes not clear yet. He had washed and his hair was smoothly brushed. He had no regularity of features such as Fairfax, being a well-set-up, ordinary young fellow, such as one might see in any American college or university. But there was a fineness in the lines of his mouth, a drollery and wit in his eyes, and he was thoroughly agreeable.  'I'm from the West,' he said, putting his glass down empty. 'Robert Dearborn, from Cincinnati--and I'm no end obliged to you, old chap, whoever you are. You've got a good breakfast there, haven't you?'  'Have some,' Antony offered with real generosity, for he was famished.  'Well,' returned Dearborn, 'to tell you the truth, I feel as if I were robbing a sleeping man to take it, for I know how fiendishly hungry you must be. But, by Jove, I haven't had a thing to eat since'--and he laughed--'since I was a child.'  He rinsed the glass that had held the bromide, poured out some black coffee for himself and took half of Fairfax's bread and half of his flower-stamped butter, and devoured it eagerly. When he had finished he wiped his mouth and genially held out his hand.  'Ever been hungry?'  Antony did not tell him how lately.  'Good,' nodded Dearborn, 'I understand. Passing through Paris?'  'Just arrived.' 	1.5	10	[1, 3, 2, 0]	VALID	1: A young man named Robert Dearborn, from Cincinnati, has breakfast with Antony, who has just arrived in Paris.  2: The passage describes Dearborn eating breakfast, which takes a few minutes. There is also a reference to Antony's recent hunger, but it's unclear how long ago that was. Let's say 10 minutes.  3: 10 minutes have elapsed. 4: 10 minutes. 5: High confidence.
522	Van MF.txt|303|l	 He limped along the Rue du Bac, his cold hands in his pockets, his head a little bent. But no battle with life now, be it what it would, could compare with his battle in New York. Now, indeed, though he was cold and hungry and tired, he was the inhabitant of a city that he loved, he was working alone for the art he adored. He believed in himself--not once had he yet come to the period of artistic despair.  During these seven months the little personal work he had been able to do had only whetted his desire; he was young, possessed of great talent and of brilliant imagination, and he was happy and hopeful and determined; the physical wants did not weigh on his spirit nor did the long period of labour injure his power of production. He chafed, indeed, but he felt his strength even as he pulled against the material things from which he had to free himself.  And as Fairfax, part of the throng, walked aimlessly up the Rue du Bac with his problems, he walked less alone that night than ever in his life, for he was absorbed in the thought of the woman. 	282240.0	820800	[2, 3, 0, 1]	VALID	1: A man walks along a street in Paris, reflecting on his life and his artistic aspirations. He thinks about his past struggles in New York and his current happiness in Paris. He is also preoccupied with thoughts of a woman. 2: There are no explicit references to time in the passage, but the man reflects on his past seven months in Paris. It's unclear how much time he spent in New York before that. Let's assume he spent a year in New York before moving to Paris.  3: One year in New York plus seven months in Paris equals 19 months. At 30 days a month, that's 570 days. At 24 hours a day, that's 13,680 hours. At 60 minutes an hour, that's 820,800 minutes. 4: 820,800 minutes. 5: Low confidence, as there is a lot of speculation involved in estimating the time spent in New York.
523	Van MF.txt|320|l	 'That,' said Dearborn with spirit, 'is rotten. Now, I will grant you that, Tony. It's rotten for her. Things have got so mixed up in your scenario that you cannot frankly go and tell her what a hog he is. That is what ought to be done, though. She ought to know what kind of a cheat and poor sort she is going to marry. In real life or drama the simple thing never happens.' Dearborn smiled finely. 'She ought to know, but you can't tell her.'  'No,' said his friend slowly, 'nor would I. But neither can I meet him in her house or anywhere else. I think I should strike him.'  'You didn't strike him, though,' said Dearborn, meaningly, 'when you had a good impersonal chance.'  'I wish I had.'  'I thought you told me they were all going to Rome?'  'Mrs. Faversham doesn't want to go.'  'Ah,' murmured Dearborn, nodding, 'she doesn't.'  'No.' Fairfax did not seem to observe his friend's tone. 'She is mightily set on having me meet Cedersholm. She wants to have him patronize me, help me!' He laughed dryly and walked up and down the studio into the cold, away from the fire, and then back to Dearborn in his dressing-gown and slippers. 'Patronize me, encourage me, pat me on the back--put me in the way of meeting men of the world of art and letters, possibly work with him. She has all sorts of kindly patronizing schemes. But she doesn't know that I have been hungry and cold, and have been housed and fed by her money. Perhaps she does, though,' he cried furiously to Dearborn. 'No doubt she does. Do you think she does, Bob?' 	2.5	5	[1, 0, 3, 2]	VALID	1: Two friends, Dearborn and Fairfax, discuss a woman who is engaged to a man who Fairfax dislikes. Fairfax is angry that the woman is trying to introduce him to the man, who he believes is a cheat. Fairfax is also angry that the woman has been supporting him financially, and wonders if she knows how much he has relied on her.  2: There is no explicit reference to time in the passage. The conversation is relatively brief and takes place in one location, so it probably only lasts a few minutes.  3: Let's say the conversation lasts five minutes.  4: 5 minutes.  5: High confidence.
524	Van MF.txt|370|l	 He hoped that he should be able to sleep and that the next day would come quickly. He became ardent and devoted as he dreamed, and all the way back his heart ached for her.  When he entered the studio and called Dearborn he received no response. There was a note from the playwright on the table--he would not be back until the next morning.  Fairfax, his hand under his pillow, crushed her letter, and the words: 'I am yours, Mary,' flushed his palm and his cheek.  *  *  *  *  *  He had been awake since dawn, fire in his blood and heart animating his brain and stimulating his creative power. In the early light he had seated himself to make a few sketches, drawing little exquisite studies of her, and the face on the paper was ideal, irritatingly so. The chin and the cheek was young and soft, too youthful for Mrs. Faversham. It suggested Bella.  When he went to see her that afternoon, for the first time he was shown upstairs. Each step was sacred to him as he mounted to the part of the house in which she lived her intimate life. The stairs were marble, covered by thick rugs; the iron balustrade had been brought from a château in the days of the Revolution. Along the wall at his side hung splendid tapestries, whose colours would have delighted him at another time. But his eyes now were blinded to material things. His soul, heart and nature were aflame, and he walked on air. When he was shown into a small room, Mrs. Faversham's own sitting-room, his agitation was so great that he seemed to walk through a mist. 	1260.0	180	[2, 0, 3, 1]	VALID	1: Fairfax, the protagonist, hopes to sleep and dreams of Mary. He returns to his studio, finds a note from his playwright, and crushes Mary's letter. The next morning, he wakes up early and draws sketches of Mary. Later that day, he visits Mrs. Faversham's house and is shown upstairs to her sitting room. 2: Fairfax's sketching probably took an hour or two. His visit to Mrs. Faversham's house might have taken an hour or two as well, given the description of the stairs and tapestries. There is no explicit reference to how much time passes between Fairfax's return to his studio and his visit to Mrs. Faversham's house, but it seems reasonable to assume that it is the same day.  3: Let's say three hours have elapsed in total. 4: 180 minutes. 5: Moderate confidence.
525	Van MF.txt|381|l	 Dearborn greeted her enthusiastically, and Tony stood petrified. The comtesse, more mistress of the moment than Tony was, put out one hand and smiled, but she had turned very pale.  It was his Aunt Caroline....  'Mr. Rainsford,' she lifted her brows, 'I think I have seen you before.'  Tony bowed over her hand and Potowski, still smiling and nodding, cried--  'These are great men and geniuses, _ma chérie_. You have here two great artists together. They both have wings on their shoulders. Before they fly away from us and are lost on Olympus, be charming to them. Carolina, _ma chérie_, they shall hear you sing.'  Robert Dearborn put his hand on Potowski's shoulder and said--  'We love your husband, madame. He has been such a bully friend to us, such a wonderful friend.'  'Poof, my dear Bobbie,' murmured Potowski.  ('J'ai perdu ma tourterelle.')  Fairfax asked, looking directly at her, 'Will you really sing for us, Madame Potowski? Can you sing some old English ballad? We have not heard a word of English for many a long day.'  Potowski wandered softly into a familiar tune. He smiled over his shoulder at his wife, and, standing by the piano, Caroline Carew--Carolina Potowski--put her hands over her husband's on the keys and indicated an accompaniment, humming.  'If you can, dear, I will sing Mr. Rainsford _this_.'  Tony took his place on the divan.  Then Madame Potowski sang:  'Flow gently, sweet Afton.' 	3.0	5	[1, 0, 2, 3]	VALID	1: A group of people greet each other, including Tony, who is surprised to see his Aunt Caroline. They chat, and then Madame Potowski sings 'Flow gently, sweet Afton.' 2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the events described seem to take place in a matter of minutes.  3: Let's say 5 minutes have elapsed.  4: 5 minutes. 5: High confidence.
526	Van MF.txt|386|l	 Among his fellow-workers in the Barye studio was the son of a millionaire pork-packer from Chicago. The young man took a tremendous liking to Antony. With a certain perspicacity, the rich young fellow divined much of his new friend's needs. He came to the studio, to their different reunions, and chummed heartily with Dearborn and Fairfax. Peterson was singularly lacking in talent and tremendously over-furnished with heart. One day, as they worked side by side in the studio of the big man, Peterson watched Antony's handling of a tiger's head.  'By Jove!' cried the Chicagoan, 'you are simply great--you are simply great! I wonder if you would be furious with me if I said something to you that is on my mind?'  The something on the simple young man's mind was that he wanted to lend Fairfax a sum of money, to be paid back when the sculptor saw fit. After a moment's hesitation Antony accepted the loan, making it one-third as much as the big-hearted chap had suggested. Fairfax set July as the date of payment, when his competitive money should come in. He borrowed just enough to keep him in food and clothes for the following months.  There were no motors in Paris then. In the mornings he drove with Mrs. Faversham to the Bois and limped by her side in the _allées_, whilst the worldly people stared at the distinguished, conspicuous couple. One day Barye himself stopped them, and to the big man Antony presented Mrs. 	120960.0	0	[1, 3, 2, 0]	CALC ERROR	1: A young man from Chicago lends Antony Fairfax some money, which he will pay back in July. Fairfax uses the money to live on while he works on his art. He spends time with Mrs. Faversham in the mornings, and one day Barye stops them and Antony introduces Mrs. Faversham to him. 2: There are a few references to time, but none of them are specific enough to give a clear sense of how much time has passed. We can guess that it might take a few weeks or months for Fairfax to use up the loan, but there's no way to be sure. 3: N/A 4: N/A 5: High confidence that there is not enough information to estimate the amount of time that has passed.
527	Van MF.txt|450|l	 She wore a long brown linen painting apron that covered her form, evidently a slender form, evidently a young form. She painted ardently, with confidence and absorption. As Antony watched her, her pose, her ardour, the poise of her body, the lovely dark head, the gestures, the fire of her, brought all of a sudden his past rushing back to him. The sight of her came to him with a thrilling, wonderful remembrance. He came forward, his light step and his heavy step falling on the hard wood floors of the museum.  She turned before he was close to her, her palette and her brushes in her hand. She stood for a moment immovable, then gave a little cry, dropped her palette and brushes on the floor, grew white, then blushed deeply and held out both her hands to him.  'Cousin Antony!'  He took her hands in his, could not find his voice even to say her name. He heard her say--  'They told me you were dead! I thought you had died long ago--I thought another man had taken your genius and your fame.'  She spoke fast, with catching breath, in a low vibrant tone that he remembered--how he did remember it! His very life seemed to breathe on her lips in the sound of her voice. 'Flow gently, sweet Afton'--the music was here--here--all the music in the world!  'I know who you are now; I saw it in the paper. I read it this morning. 	1.0	3	[0, 1, 3, 2]	VALID	1: Antony sees a young woman painting in a museum. He recognizes her as a cousin he thought was dead. She is surprised to see him and thought he had died long ago.  2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the passage describes a series of actions that would take a few minutes at most.  3: Let's say three minutes have elapsed.  4: 3 minutes. 5: High confidence.
528	Van MF.txt|451|l	I saw your picture, and I knew.' She stopped to catch her breath deeply. 'Oh, I'm so glad!'  She was more beautiful than he had dreamed she would be; brilliant, bewitching, and the flowers of his past clustered round her.  'I heard them falling through the rooms, the light step and the heavy step.'  Slowly by both her hands which he held he drew her toward him, and as he held her cheek against his lips he heard her murmur--  'Back from the dead! Cousin Antony.... No, just Antony!'  'Little cousin!' he said. 'Bella!'  THE END	1.0	3	[3, 1, 2, 0]	VALID	1: A man and a woman are reunited, and they exchange endearments.  2: There is no explicit reference to time, but the passage describes a conversation and a physical embrace. This probably took a few minutes.  3: Let's say three minutes have elapsed.  4: 3 minutes.  5: High confidence.
529	PratMFS.txt|0|l	FAMILY SECRETS.  CHAPTER I. IN one of the southern vales of Devon, where the myrtle is said to bloom unprotected, though visited by the sea-breeze, stood Fitzorton Castle. A writer of descriptive talents, might, in respect of situation, expand himself into volumes; but, as the delineation of the minds and manners, the passions and pursuits, the strength and weakness, imaginations, and studies, of human beings, are more immediately the objects of this history, we must consider vegetable beauty, however fascinating, but as the scenery of our picture, and dismiss this part of our subject with as few words as possible. The castle was erected on the sloping of a hill; the Manor-house of Clare on the declivity of an opposite mountain, with a uniformity of taste corresponding to the sentiment which had long united the families; and at a distance only to render the prospect more engaging, a third venerable pile reared its head so centrically between the two, that, whether viewed from the manor-house or from the castle, the eye surveyed its aspiring turrets, the majestic avenues that led to its folding-gates, and the delightful woods that stretched themselves on either side. Indeed, the three domains were placed amidst the very romance of Nature; but we are called from them at present by an earnest desire to introduce the reader to their inhabitants.   CHAPTER II. 	157680000.0	0	[2, 3, 0, 1]	CALC ERROR	1: This passage describes the setting of Fitzorton Castle and two other nearby buildings, but does not describe any events or actions.  2: No explicit reference to time is given.
