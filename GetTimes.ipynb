      " 2: Reason step by step to decide how much time is described in the passage. If the passage doesn't include any explicit reference to time, you can guess how much time the events described would have taken. Even description can imply the passage of time by mentioning the earlier history of people or buildings. But characters' references to the past or future in spoken dialogue should not count as time that passed in the scene. Report the time using units of years, weeks, days, hours, or minutes. Do not say zero or N/A.\n",

      " “Hey! Friggin idea! You gals go out there and mow some friggin parrot jungle down and the kid 'n me makes a round.”  Hoop rushed toward the bar, a substantial rattan-and-hardwood thing I hadn't noticed, dusty in a corner of the patio. Virginia and Constance went out with a pair of shears.  “Would you look at the dust!” Hoop yelled. “Find me some swabbin gear, Chief.”  I went in the kitchen, made us two drinks, and returned with a rag and soap. “She's been making them in there.”  “I know, for Christ sake. Broad's got this bar from the islands, beautiful friggin teak here, won't use it. We take it apart and hide it on board and get it here and get it back together—that's the friggin miracle, and tight when we busted her up—no friggin numbers on it like your dinosaurs and shit.”  “Where was this?”  “Mutton fart capital of the world.”  “You were in the navy?”  “Guam, Guadalcanal, one of them G islands. No, Seabees. All them islands is alike. This bastard could've come from the halls of friggin Montezuma. What the shit difference. It's heavy, pure-quill teak, we stole it from an operating whorehouse, we got it here is the thing. Contrabandits! Joke!”  Hoop threw the rag and soap bottle at the bar's small chrome sink. “Whore called Five-ton sits on it, crying, see? Because Stump and me are having at it with screwdrivers, see?” He goes into falsetto. “ ‘I love you, Joes, no shit, Joes, but need post office for sell love.' Five-ton whines this at us, see? Imagine that: some wiseheimy tells 'em a friggin whorehouse is a post office and they buy it. ‘You want first class, Joe?' It was a scream. ‘You want special delivery?' There Five-ton is, trying to hold the bar down, crying, and Stump and me start pulling it apart. Beautiful.” He is wiping the bar with great, broad strokes. I already feel drunk again. Hoop's rag is steaming in vigorous circles on the teak. \n",
